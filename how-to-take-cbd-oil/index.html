As a wellness supplement, cannabidiol has a wealth\r\n                        of benefits, ranging from sleep support[1] to possible pain relief[2] to stress management[3] \u2014 and more.\r\n                        As versatile as CBD is in supporting the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system,[4] CBD is equally versatile\r\n                        in its forms of delivery. \r\n                    Although this remarkable cannabinoid begins its life in the hemp plant and is extracted as CBD\r\n                        oil, where it goes from there is as varied as the imaginations of CBD hemp innovators, like the\r\n                        research team at CBDfx. We offer hemp-derived CBD products in a broad range of forms, because we\r\n                        know that people who take CBD have different needs and lifestyles. When it comes to shopping for\r\n                        CBD products, it\u2019s all about finding the right one for you. \r\n                    So, with that in mind, let\u2019s explore the different ways you can take CBD and the CBD products\r\n                        available in each category.\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        \r\n                            A Quick Note About Bioavailability\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n                                    The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d\r\n                                        refers to the extent and\r\n                                        rate at which the\r\n                                            body absorbs a compound into the bloodstream \u2014 in this case, CBD.\r\n                                        Different methods of delivery offer different bioavailability. \r\n                                    For example, CBD oil tinctures can be taken sublingually or they can be blended\r\n                                        with food or drink, qualifying them as a CBD edible. Because CBD taken\r\n                                        sublingually enters the bloodstream quicker than CBD edibles, which have to pass\r\n                                        through the digestive system, you feel the effects of the sublingual CBD\r\n                                        tincture quicker. \r\n                                    There are other factors that affect your CBD\u2019s bioavailability, as well. These\r\n                                        include all the things that make your own body unique, including height, weight,\r\n                                        metabolism, and your tolerance to CBD and other cannabinoids from prior\r\n                                        cannabis/CBD use. Everyone is different, and CBD can affect each of us in a\r\n                                        different way. Another factor in the bioavailability of your CBD is the strength\r\n                                        of the CBD product you choose. This not only includes the milligrams of CBD in\r\n                                        your serving, but also the kind of CBD in your product:\r\n                                        \r\n                                            full spectrum CBD vs. broad spectrum CBD vs. CBD isolate. \r\n                                    In this discussion on how to take CBD, we\u2019re going to concentrate on methods of\r\n                                        delivery.\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                                    \r\n                                    \r\n                                    \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n                \r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                        \r\n                            Sublingual CBD\r\n                            Sublingual,[5] literally, means under the tongue. This refers to the method of\r\n                                administration in which the CBD is absorbed through the capillaries under the tongue. In\r\n                                the case of sublingual CBD strips or CBD tinctures, the CBD product is held under the\r\n                                tongue for 60 seconds. This allows for maximum absorption. \r\n                            The benefit of taking CBD sublingually is that this method allows the CBD to enter the\r\n                                bloodstream quickly and you feel the effects of the CBD faster than by other methods.\r\n                                This can happen as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on some of the other bioavailability\r\n                                factors mentioned above. \r\n                            Sublingual CBD can be absorbed at a much higher rate than CBD edibles. This is because\r\n                                CBD edibles, like CBD cookies or CBD capsules, have to pass through the digestive system\r\n                                and, in the process, lose some of their strength. CBD taken sublingually can have a\r\n                                bioavailability range of 15\u201335%. A good carrier oil, like natural\r\n                                coconut-derived\r\n                                    MCT oil, helps the body to bump that number into the higher part of that range.\r\n                            \r\n                            Absorbing CBD at a higher rate allows you to lower your dosage and still get the same\r\n                                effectiveness as other products. As methods of delivery go, sublingual is a solid,\r\n                                effective choice.\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Oil Tincture\r\n                            There are a\r\n                                    lot of reasons to love CBD tinctures. For one, they\u2019re versatile. You can\r\n                                take CBD oil sublingually, as mentioned above. But you can also take CBD oil tinctures\r\n                                as an edible, either swallowing them straight from the dropper or mixing them in with\r\n                                your favorite foods or drinks. This not only gives you the enjoyable \u201cchill\u201d of CBD, but\r\n                                it also allows you to open up your cookbook or cocktail guide and get creative. In fact,\r\n                                bar menus of several popular and trendy clubs[6] are filling up with CBD-infused drinks.\r\n                                And CBD recipes can be\r\n                                found all over the internet. \r\n                            For sublingual use, extract the CBD oil with the provided dropper and place it under the\r\n                                tongue. Allow the CBD tincture to sit there for 60 seconds for maximum absorption. Try\r\n                                not to eat or drink anything else for another 10 minutes, thus allowing any residual CBD\r\n                                oil tincture to still sink in. \r\n                            As for serving size, our CBD tinctures come in a variety of strengths, ranging from 17mg\r\n                                CBD (in our 500mg bottles) to 100mg CBD (in our 6000mg bottles) per one-dropper serving.\r\n                                Our advice is to start with the lowest possible dosage, so that you can properly assess\r\n                                your tolerance level. If you don\u2019t feel any effects, bump up your serving size the next\r\n                                day. Keep doing this until you find your own personal Goldilocks serving that\u2019s \u201cjust\r\n                                right\u201d to you. \r\n                            Do not try to bump up your dosage the same day, though. Not only will you undercut your\r\n                                ability to determine the effectiveness of your first serving, but you may also\r\n                                inadvertently build up your tolerance level, making future doses less effective. \r\n                            Store your CBD oil tincture at room temperature, away from light (in a drawer or\r\n                                cupboard) as direct light may degrade the oil over time. \r\n                            We offer three effective CBD oil tinctures, each with its own unique purpose.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            Our CBD + CBG Oil\r\n                                    Wellness Tincture takes advantage of the Entourage\r\n                                    Effect, the\r\n                                phenomenon that happens when you ingest multiple cannabinoids. Instead of simply working\r\n                                in parallel with each other, the two cannabinoids enhance each other\u2019s effects, creating\r\n                                a deeper CBD experience. In this case, broad spectrum CBD and the \u201cmother of all\r\n                                cannabinoids,\u201d CBG \u2014 in addition to special terpenes, curcumin and coenzyme Q10 \u2014\r\n                                combine to give you a blast of wellness benefits.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            Our CBD +\r\n                                    CBN Oil Calming Tincture also makes use of the Entourage Effect, but this time\r\n                                combining full spectrum CBD with the \u201cultimate relaxation cannabinoid,\u201d CBN. Along with\r\n                                a proprietary blend of calming terpenes, this one-two cannabinoid punch relaxes the body\r\n                                and calms the mind. It\u2019s the perfect drop of afternoon \u201cchill.\u201d\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            Our CBD Oil Sleep\r\n                                    Tincture is the ultimate natural sleep aid. Combining broad spectrum\r\n                                CBD with CBN, plus a full 5mg dose of melatonin and a special blend of sleep terpenes,\r\n                                this CBD sleep tincture allows you to get to sleep quickly and sleep uninterrupted\r\n                                through the night, without the morning hangover feeling associated with most sleeping\r\n                                pills.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Edibles\r\n                            CBD edibles have the lowest\r\n                                bioavailability rate among delivery methods (5\u201315%). This is\r\n                                because the CBD has to pass through the digestive system, losing some of its strength\r\n                                along the way. But there are also benefits to consuming CBD as an edible. One of those\r\n                                benefits is that the CBD you do absorb stays in your system for a longer period of time,\r\n                                allowing you to experience its benefits longer. While it might take your CBD edible 20\r\n                                minutes to two hours to kick in, you could potentially enjoy its effects all day long,\r\n                                which is one reason CBD Morning\r\n                                    Capsules are so popular. \r\n                            Another advantage of CBD edibles is that many of them are, frankly, enjoyable to consume.\r\n                                From CBD gummies to CBD cookies, there are a lot of tasty options out there. And with\r\n                                pre-portioned servings, they\u2019re simple for beginners to take. Just look at the serving\r\n                                size and follow the directions. \r\n                            For instance, the serving size of our original Mixed Berry CBD\r\n                                    Gummies is two delicious\r\n                                gummies. You may choose to begin with one gummy to gauge your tolerance, before trying a\r\n                                full dose. Otherwise, consumption is easy: Just eat!\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Gummies\r\n                            CBD Gummies are among our most\r\n                                popular CBD products, because they\u2019re not only effective\r\n                                and packed full of vegan, organic broad spectrum CBD, as well as other health-boosting\r\n                                ingredients, but they\u2019re also delicious treats.

We\u2019ve already mentioned the rise and shine power of our CBD + CBG Morning\r\n                                Capsules for Energy and Focus, but we also offer two other options that are equally\r\n                                effective. Our CBD Soft Gel\r\n                                    Capsules give you all the effects of full spectrum CBD,\r\n                                along with a rich profile of minor cannabinoids, in a convenient cap. And our CBD + CBN\r\n                                Night Capsules for Sleep are a nightstand essential for those dealing with insomnia or\r\n                                other sleep problems. Many people pair our CBD Morning Capsules and CBD Night Capsules\r\n                                for around-the-clock CBD\r\n                                    wellness benefits.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Snacks and CBD-Infused Foods\r\n                            As mentioned, CBD tinctures give you the flexibility to add a dose of CBD to nearly any\r\n                                appetizer, meal, snack or dessert. Just pick a recipe and drop in the CBD oil. It\u2019s that\r\n                                simple. \r\n                            CBD is also available in packaged foods. At CBDfx, we like to indulge our sweet tooths.\r\n                                And that means cookies! Our vegan CBD Cookies with\r\n                                    Protein pack 20mg of broad spectrum\r\n                                CBD into each tasty treat, along with 13g of muscle-building protein.

But yes, CBD drinks are considered\r\n                                CBD edibles\r\n                                \u2014 even though you drink them instead of eating them. So, expect an absorption rate\r\n                                similar to CBD gummies, CBD cookies, and other CBD edibles. \r\n                            Our CBD drinks come in two formulations: CBD Chill Shots and CBD\r\n                                    Focus Shots. Our CBD\r\n                                Chill Shots (available in Lemonade and Berry flavors) give you a breezy, calm vibe. Our\r\n                                CBD Focus Shots (available in Pomegranate and Tropical flavors) are a tasty, natural\r\n                                alternative to sugary energy drinks \u2014 giving you a blast of energy and focus.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Topicals\r\n                            Topical CBD products can give\r\n                                localized relief to dry and irritated skin, as well as\r\n                                aches and pains in the muscles and joints. CBD topicals come in a variety of forms, from\r\n                                CBD creams and CBD balms to CBD masks and CBD bath bombs. These hemp-derived CBD\r\n                                products offer an effective, natural alternative to sports creams and bath products,\r\n                                which are often loaded with chemical perfumes and additives that can be ineffective,\r\n                                clog pores, stain bathtubs, and leave a strong, unpleasant scent. Our organic CBD\r\n                                products are also cruelty-free and contain no GMOs. The bioavailability rate of CBD\r\n                                topicals is quite high, compared to some other delivery methods, potentially reaching\r\n                                45%.\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Creams and CBD Balms\r\n                            CBD creams and CBD balm sticks are easy to apply. Simply cover the affected area and let\r\n                                it sit for an hour. If you don\u2019t feel any relief by that time, you can reapply as\r\n                                necessary. It\u2019s unlikely you can take too much CBD through a cream or balm, but we\r\n                                recommend no more than 3 or 4 applications per day. \r\n                            CBDfx offers a good assortment of CBD topicals for pain relief in muscles and joints. Our\r\n                                rapidly absorbing CBD Cream for\r\n                                    Muscle &amp; Joint: Cooling Formula offers relief for aches\r\n                                and pains with up to 3000mg of broad spectrum CBD, along with anti-inflammatory\r\n                                botanicals, pain-relieving caffeine, and cool, soothing menthol. It\u2019s a must for every\r\n                                training table and medicine cabinet. Our CBD Balm Stick Muscle and\r\n                                    Joint offers similar\r\n                                relief for aches and pains, but in a convenient stick form \u2014 making it the perfect\r\n                                grab-and-go pain reliever for every gym bag. Our CBD Foot\r\n                                    Cream pampers your aching\r\n                                feet, not only soothing soreness, but also gently softening your skin \u2014 restoring and\r\n                                detoxifying your feet. It\u2019s the next best thing to a professional foot rub. \r\n                            Our CBD Balm Stick Calming and\r\n                                    Moisturizing pampers your skin with relaxing broad\r\n                                spectrum CBD, soothing shea butter and Roman chamomile oil, and calming botanicals.

CBD\r\n                                    Face Masks, in particular, provide a spa-quality treatment for every contour of\r\n                                your\r\n                                face. These come in five specially formulated options: Aloe Vera for soothing and\r\n                                tightening, Charcoal for purifying and brightening, Cucumber for hydrating and\r\n                                tightening, Lavender for relaxing and soothing, and Rose for toning and\r\n                                moisturizing. \r\n                            CBD Face Masks are simple to use. First, wash your face with a gentle, all-natural\r\n                                cleanser and allow it to air dry. Take the mask out of the packaging and flatten it out.\r\n                                Then, place it on your face, cloth side down, aligning the holes with your eyes, nose\r\n                                and mouth. Then, peel off the plastic backside of the mask so that it can mold into the\r\n                                contours of your face. Make sure your CBD face mask fully adheres, so there are no\r\n                                bubbles or air pockets. Leave the mask on for 10 minutes, then remove and throw it away.\r\n                                You can gently pat in places where the serum has yet to absorb. Otherwise, don\u2019t wash\r\n                                your face. Your freshly revitalized skin is good to go! \r\n                            CBD Foot\r\n                                    Masks are even easier to use on your aching peds. Just slip on the booties and\r\n                                kick your feet up for 20 minutes. When you remove the booties, simply rub in any excess\r\n                                CBD oil on your feet. The single-use CBD masks for feet can be thrown away when you\u2019re\r\n                                finished. These soothing CBD foot masks come in two formulations: Peppermint for cooling\r\n                                and relaxing your feet, as well as refreshing and relaxing Lavender.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Bath Bombs\r\n                            CBD Bath Bombs give you\r\n                                spa-quality indulgence in the privacy of your home. Simply drop\r\n                                the single-use bath bomb into your bath water, swirl the bath water around with your\r\n                                hand or toes, and wait for it to dissolve. Then, enjoy a luxurious soak in 200mg of\r\n                                organic broad spectrum CBD, plus botanicals and nutrients to soothe and pamper your\r\n                                body. We recommend a 20 to 40-minute soak to make full use of the active ingredients.\r\n                                These all-natural CBD Bath Bombs have no artificial dyes or colors, so they won\u2019t stain\r\n                                your tub or irritate your skin. Our CBD Bath Bombs come in two formulations: Soothing\r\n                                Lavender and Recharge Eucalyptus.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Vapes\r\n                            Of all the available options of CBD delivery, nothing tops vaporizing in terms of\r\n                                bioavailability. With CBD vapes, you can absorb up to 50% of the active ingredients.\r\n                                Unlike other vapes, our CBD vape products contain no nicotine or THC, and only use pure,\r\n                                organic CBD isolate.\r\n                        \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Vape Pens\r\n                            CBD vape pens are incredibly\r\n                                easy to\r\n                                    use, and come in a variety of flavors. Simply place\r\n                                the open end in your mouth and inhale. Usually one or two puffs will do the trick. Pause\r\n                                and see if you feel the effects. You can take more if you have a higher tolerance. CBD\r\n                                vapes are non-toxic, so the only real effect you might feel if you take too much is that\r\n                                you will probably get drowsy. \r\n                            There are no buttons or plug-ins in our CBD vape pens. And no need to charge. When the\r\n                                battery runs out or, more likely, you run out of juice, simply throw the pen away. Our\r\n                                pens hold approximately 400 puffs for most users.\r\n                            Our broad range of CBD vape pen flavors include Fresh Mint,\r\n                                Blue Raspberry,\r\n                                Strawberry\r\n                                    Lemonade, Tropic\r\n                                    Breeze, OG\r\n                                    Kush, and Pineapple\r\n                                    Express. \r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            CBD Vape Juices and Liquids\r\n                            Many vapers prefer a reusable CBD\r\n                                    Vape Kit, which can be refilled with your choice of CBD\r\n                                    juices and liquids. To power on your vape kit, first press the power button five\r\n                                times\r\n                                in quick succession. After this, you\u2019ll see the device power on and the LED light will\r\n                                blink pink/purple five times. Once the device is powered on, you should see the button\r\n                                light up blue any time you press it. To vape, you\u2019ll need to hold this button down\r\n                                through the length of the inhale. As with vape pens, one or two puffs should suffice,\r\n                                though it\u2019s okay to take a couple more puffs if you can\u2019t feel anything.\r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            \r\n                            The fun thing about using a CBD Vape Kit is the variety of juices and liquids you can\r\n                                experiment with \u2014 each available in 500\u20132000mg bottles. Our CBD vape juice flavors\r\n                                include the fruity fun of Blue\r\n                                    Raspberry, Wild\r\n                                    Watermelon and Strawberry\r\n                                    Kiwi, plus\r\n                                nostalgic favorites, Spearmint\r\n                                    Gum and Strawberry\r\n                                    Milk. We also have CBD terpene vape\r\n                                liquids, available in 500 and 1000mg bottles. These CBD terpene vapes come in a variety\r\n                                of classic cannabis flavors, including OG Kush, Pineapple\r\n                                    Express, Gelato, and Platinum\r\n                                    Rose.

                    <p>If you’ve read some of our other helpful blogs, you know a little bit about <a href="../what-is-cbd/index.html">what CBD is</a> and <a href="../the-benefits-of-cbd/index.html">some
                        of the benefits</a> of this fascinating compound. As a wellness supplement, cannabidiol has a wealth
                        of benefits, ranging from sleep support<sup>[1]</sup> to possible pain relief<sup>[2]</sup> to stress management<sup>[3]</sup> — and more.
                        As versatile as CBD is in supporting the body’s endocannabinoid system,<sup>[4]</sup> CBD is equally versatile
                        in its forms of delivery. </p>
                    <p>Although this remarkable cannabinoid begins its life in the hemp plant and is extracted as CBD
                        oil, where it goes from there is as varied as the imaginations of CBD hemp innovators, like the
                        research team at CBDfx. We offer hemp-derived CBD products in a broad range of forms, because we
                        know that people who take CBD have different needs and lifestyles. When it comes to shopping for
                        CBD products, it’s all about finding the right one for you. </p>
                    <p>So, with that in mind, let’s explore the different ways you can take CBD and the CBD products
                        available in each category.</p>

                                        refers to the extent and

                                            body absorbs</a> a compound into the bloodstream — in this case, CBD.
                                        Different methods of delivery offer different bioavailability. </p>
                                    <p>For example, CBD oil tinctures can be taken sublingually or they can be blended
                                        with food or drink, qualifying them as a CBD edible. Because CBD taken
                                        sublingually enters the bloodstream quicker than CBD edibles, which have to pass
                                        through the digestive system, you feel the effects of the sublingual CBD
                                        tincture quicker. </p>
                                    <p>There are other factors that affect your CBD’s bioavailability, as well. These
                                        include all the things that make your own body unique, including height, weight,
                                        metabolism, and your tolerance to CBD and other cannabinoids from prior
                                        cannabis/CBD use. Everyone is different, and CBD can affect each of us in a
                                        different way. Another factor in the bioavailability of your CBD is the strength
                                        of the CBD product you choose. This not only includes the milligrams of CBD in
                                        your serving, but also the kind of CBD in your product:

                            <h2>Sublingual CBD</h2>
                            <p>Sublingual,<sup>[5]</sup> literally, means under the tongue. This refers to the method of
                                administration in which the CBD is absorbed through the capillaries under the tongue. In
                                the case of sublingual CBD strips or CBD tinctures, the CBD product is held under the
                                tongue for 60 seconds. This allows for maximum absorption. </p>
                            <p>The benefit of taking CBD sublingually is that this method allows the CBD to enter the
                                bloodstream quickly and you feel the effects of the CBD faster than by other methods.
                                This can happen as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on some of the other bioavailability
                                factors mentioned above. </p>
                            <p>Sublingual CBD can be absorbed at a much higher rate than CBD edibles. This is because
                                CBD edibles, like CBD cookies or CBD capsules, have to pass through the digestive system
                                and, in the process, lose some of their strength. CBD taken sublingually can have a
                                bioavailability range of 15–35%. A good carrier oil, like natural
                                <a href="../heres-why-mct-oil-is-used-in-every-cbdfx-product/index.html">coconut-derived
                                    MCT oil</a>, helps the body to bump that number into the higher part of that range.
                            </p>
                            <p>Absorbing CBD at a higher rate allows you to lower your dosage and still get the same
                                effectiveness as other products. As methods of delivery go, sublingual is a solid,
                                effective choice.</p>

                            <h3>CBD Oil Tincture</h3>
                            <p><a href="../8-reasons-youll-love-our-1500mg-cbd-tinctures/index.html">There are a
                                    lot of reasons</a> to love CBD tinctures. For one, they’re versatile. You can
                                take CBD oil sublingually, as mentioned above. But you can also take CBD oil tinctures
                                as an edible, either swallowing them straight from the dropper or mixing them in with
                                your favorite foods or drinks. This not only gives you the enjoyable “chill” of CBD, but
                                it also allows you to open up your cookbook or cocktail guide and get creative. In fact,
                                bar menus of several popular and trendy clubs<sup>[6]</sup> are filling up with CBD-infused drinks.
                                And <a href="../4-cbd-desserts-you-need-to-try/index.html">CBD recipes</a> can be
                                found all over the internet. </p>
                            <p>For sublingual use, extract the CBD oil with the provided dropper and place it under the
                                tongue. Allow the CBD tincture to sit there for 60 seconds for maximum absorption. Try
                                not to eat or drink anything else for another 10 minutes, thus allowing any residual CBD
                                oil tincture to still sink in. </p>
                            <p>As for serving size, our CBD tinctures come in a variety of strengths, ranging from 17mg
                                CBD (in our 500mg bottles) to 100mg CBD (in our 6000mg bottles) per one-dropper serving.
                                Our advice is to start with the lowest possible dosage, so that you can properly assess
                                your tolerance level. If you don’t feel any effects, bump up your serving size the next
                                day. Keep doing this until you find your own personal Goldilocks serving that’s “just
                                right” to you. </p>
                            <p>Do not try to bump up your dosage the same day, though. Not only will you undercut your
                                ability to determine the effectiveness of your first serving, but you may also
                                inadvertently build up your tolerance level, making future doses less effective. </p>
                            <p>Store your CBD oil tincture at room temperature, away from light (in a drawer or
                                cupboard) as direct light may degrade the oil over time. </p>
                            <p>We offer three effective CBD oil tinctures, each with its own unique purpose.</p>

                            <h2>CBD Edibles</h2>
                            <p><a href="../collections/cbd-edibles/index.html">CBD edibles</a> have the lowest
                                bioavailability rate among delivery methods (5–15%). This is
                                because the CBD has to pass through the digestive system, losing some of its strength
                                along the way. But there are also benefits to consuming CBD as an edible. One of those
                                benefits is that the CBD you do absorb stays in your system for a longer period of time,
                                allowing you to experience its benefits longer. While it might take your CBD edible 20
                                minutes to two hours to kick in, you could potentially enjoy its effects all day long,
                                which is one reason <a

                                    Capsules</a> are so popular. </p>
                            <p>Another advantage of CBD edibles is that many of them are, frankly, enjoyable to consume.
                                From CBD gummies to CBD cookies, there are a lot of tasty options out there. And with
                                pre-portioned servings, they’re simple for beginners to take. Just look at the serving
                                size and follow the directions. </p>
                            <p>For instance, the serving size of our original <a

                            <h2>CBD Topicals</h2>
                            <p><a href="../collections/cbd-topicals/index.html">Topical CBD products</a> can give
                                localized relief to dry and irritated skin, as well as
                                aches and pains in the muscles and joints. CBD topicals come in a variety of forms, from
                                CBD creams and CBD balms to CBD masks and CBD bath bombs. These hemp-derived CBD
                                products offer an effective, natural alternative to sports creams and bath products,
                                which are often loaded with chemical perfumes and additives that can be ineffective,
                                clog pores, stain bathtubs, and leave a strong, unpleasant scent. Our organic CBD
                                products are also cruelty-free and contain no GMOs. The bioavailability rate of CBD
                                topicals is quite high, compared to some other delivery methods, potentially reaching
                                45%.</p>

                            <p>CBD creams and CBD balm sticks are easy to apply. Simply cover the affected area and let
                                it sit for an hour. If you don’t feel any relief by that time, you can reapply as
                                necessary. It’s unlikely you can take too much CBD through a cream or balm, but we
                                recommend no more than 3 or 4 applications per day. </p>
                                <p>CBDfx offers a good assortment of CBD topicals for pain relief in muscles and joints.</p>

                            <p>CBD masks are easy to use and a great way to treat your skin and soothe your mind. <a
                                        href="../products/cbd-face-mask/index.html">CBD
                                    Face Masks</a>, in particular, provide a spa-quality treatment for every contour of
                                your
                                face. These come in five specially formulated options: Aloe Vera for soothing and
                                tightening, Charcoal for purifying and brightening, Cucumber for hydrating and
                                tightening, Lavender for relaxing and soothing, and Rose for toning and
                                moisturizing. </p>
                            <p>CBD Face Masks are simple to use. First, wash your face with a gentle, all-natural
                                cleanser and allow it to air dry. Take the mask out of the packaging and flatten it out.
                                Then, place it on your face, cloth side down, aligning the holes with your eyes, nose
                                and mouth. Then, peel off the plastic backside of the mask so that it can mold into the
                                contours of your face. Make sure your CBD face mask fully adheres, so there are no
                                bubbles or air pockets. Leave the mask on for 10 minutes, then remove and throw it away.
                                You can gently pat in places where the serum has yet to absorb. Otherwise, don’t wash
                                your face. Your freshly revitalized skin is good to go! </p>
                            <p><a href="../products/cbd-foot-masks-lavender-peppermint-50mg/index.html">CBD Foot
                                    Masks</a> are even easier to use on your aching peds. Just slip on the booties and
                                kick your feet up for 20 minutes. When you remove the booties, simply rub in any excess
                                CBD oil on your feet. The single-use CBD masks for feet can be thrown away when you’re
                                finished. These soothing CBD foot masks come in two formulations: Peppermint for cooling
                                and relaxing your feet, as well as refreshing and relaxing Lavender.</p>

                                the open end in your mouth and inhale. Usually one or two puffs will do the trick. Pause
                                and see if you feel the effects. You can take more if you have a higher tolerance. CBD
                                vapes are non-toxic, so the only real effect you might feel if you take too much is that
                                you will probably get drowsy. </p>
                            <p>There are no buttons or plug-ins in our CBD vape pens. And no need to charge. When the
                                battery runs out or, more likely, you run out of juice, simply throw the pen away. Our
                                pens hold approximately 400 puffs for most users.</p>

                                in quick succession. After this, you’ll see the device power on and the LED light will

                                through the length of the inhale. As with vape pens, one or two puffs should suffice,
                                though it’s okay to take a couple more puffs if you can’t feel anything.</p>

                                is a hit with pups and putty tats everywhere. With calming and health-boosting benefits,
                                it’s a must for every pet pantry. </p>
