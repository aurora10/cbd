<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) is well known for its calming wellness benefits. Full spectrum CBD, containing all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cannabinoids</strong></a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>, is the most robust of all CBD oils and delivers the most powerful CBD experience. <strong>THC</strong> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong></a>) also delivers a bevy of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and blissful mood enhancement. Together, these two cannabinoids make an ideal choice for people looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among CBD’s best-known effects are its gentle calming properties that relax the mind and the body. This is especially notable when you take full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> raises the relaxation factor with additional “chill” properties.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD and delta-9 THC both deliver strong relaxation effects, this edible product works great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety for some people, if left unchecked.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most notable effects of delta-9 THC is epic mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Chocolate Chip Cookie is formulated to deliver a blissful peace of mind, plus waves of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with receptors in the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC also delivers many health and wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the most robust of all types of CBD oil. It is the unfiltered oil extract as it is initially derived from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves, and stalks. Full spectrum oil contains all of hemp’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. This includes such notable compounds as CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there is such a thing as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, these are considered “minor cannabinoids,” meaning they only occur in the tiniest quantities in cannabis. Delta-9 THC, on the other hand, is a major cannabinoid and is the psychoactive compound most associated with cannabis. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the compound that is known for getting you high if you take enough of it (as with marijuana). But delta-9 THC also has a number of health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p>It takes a bit longer to feel the effects <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, compared to a vape product or sublingual oil. This is because, when you swallow your cookie, the CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, tolerance, and metabolism, as well as the amount of CBD or THC in your edible product. The benefit of taking THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer than other products, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>Our Most Potent Cookie Ever!</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 THC Chocolate Chip Cookie delivers 20mg each of full spectrum CBD and THC. This gives you two full servings of delta-9 bliss in every one of these delectable edibles. As with every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection, this cookie is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 cookie, and we wish you the very best on your wellness journey.</p>
<div class="hub-drug-tests-notice col-12 p-4" style="border:1px solid red"><strong>Ingesting or inhaling products that contain delta-9 THC could result in the consumer failing a drug test for marijuana.</strong></div>

					<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our CBD Gummies With Mushrooms for Wellness combine the calming wellness benefits of CBD with the adaptogenic and nootropic properties of cordyceps, chaga, turkey tail, lion’s mane, and other mushrooms (50mg per serving!). Available in a delicious black cherry flavor, these health-boosting gummies are great for daily wellness, as well as other benefits, including immune response, stress relief, anti-inflammatory support, and much more. CBD Wellness Mushroom Gummies are a healthy and tasty way to start your day!</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CBD Gummies With Mushrooms for Wellness</h2>
<p>For millennia, people have recognized the health and wellness potential in eating <strong>mushrooms</strong>. More recently, we’ve learned about the adaptogenic properties of many such fungi, as well as the nootropic effects of some mushrooms. These natural health supplements pair perfectly with CBD, the hottest wellness product on the market. Our <strong>CBD Mushroom Gummies</strong> give you seven potent mushrooms in a delicious black cherry-flavored gummy, making our Wellness Gummies a wonderful addition to any morning health regimen.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Mushrooms</h2>
<p>The <strong>benefits of mushrooms</strong> depend, to a large extent, on which mushrooms you’re talking about. We use seven different mushrooms in our Wellness Gummies: chaga, cordyceps, lion’s mane, reishi, maitake, turkey tail, and shiitake. Each of these <strong>shrooms</strong> is notable for having either adaptogenic or nootropic properties (some have both!).</p>
<p><strong>Adaptogens</strong> are chemical compounds that reduce stress on the body. <strong>Nootropics</strong> are compounds believed to improve cognitive function by stimulating the repair and growth of new nervous system cells, fighting inflammation in brain cells, maximizing oxygen use in brain and nervous tissue, and supporting mood and sleep.</p>
<p>All of the mushrooms we use are organically grown and wild harvested in the USA. The mushroom extracts we use are pulled from the sporocarp, or fruiting body, of the fungi using a clean water spraying method. The result is the purest and most potent mushroom extract available, with no residual chemicals in your gummies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at the shrooms used in our delightful gummies. Every serving delivers 7.1mg of each mushroom!</span></p>
<h3>Chaga</h3>
<p><strong>Chaga</strong> mushrooms are considered to have both adaptogenic and nootropic properties. These mushrooms have been used for many centuries for immune support, as well as overall health and wellness benefits. Chaga mushrooms are also packed with important vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B complex, vitamin D, potassium, and more.</p>
<h3>Cordyceps</h3>
<p><strong><em>C</em></strong><strong>ordyceps</strong> are also believed to have both adaptogenic and nootropic benefits. Cordyceps mushrooms have been studied for their potential to help reduce stress on the body, increasing resistance to stress-inducing activity. These mushrooms are often used to provide energy (some even take cordyceps to boost libido), and are a wonderful source for vitamins B1, B2, B12 and K.</p>
<h3>Lion’s Mane</h3>
<p>Traditionally, <strong>lion’s mane</strong> mushrooms (sometimes called “lion mane”) have been taken for their adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and stop inflammation. Lion’s mane is also believed to have positive nootropic benefits for the brain and neurological system. These mushrooms are a valuable source of vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy carbohydrates, amino acids, and more.</p>
<h3>Reishi</h3>
<p><strong>Reishi</strong> mushrooms are also commonly used for their adaptogenic benefits. Reishi is believed to support the adrenal glands, which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. These mushrooms are a potent source of vitamins (especially vitamin D), minerals, amino acids, and dietary fiber.</p>
<h3>Maitake</h3>
<p><strong>Maitake</strong> is another adaptogenic mushroom, long taken for its beneficial immunity, antioxidant, and wellness effects. Among maitake’s many nutrients are vitamins B and C, copper and other minerals, potassium, beta-glucans, amino acids, and fiber.</p>
<h3>Turkey tail (a.k.a. Turkeytail)</h3>
<p><strong>Turkey tail</strong> is an adaptogenic mushroom, well known for its immune support stemming from two different polysaccharopeptides, which are abundant in this healthful fungus. Turkey tail also contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, as well as vitamins B3 and D.</p>
<h3>Shiitake</h3>
<p><strong>Shiitake</strong> mushrooms are considered both adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms. These potent mushrooms are rich in polysaccharides, such as lentians and other beta-glucans, which protect against cell damage, promote immune function, and have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<h2>How Do CBD Mushroom Gummies Work?</h2>
<p>CBD Mushroom Gummies are edibles (to state the obvious). Simply eat two gummies to get a full dose of CBD (25mg CBD per gummy; 50mg CBD per serving) and health-boosting mushrooms.</p>
<p>As gummies are edibles, the CBD and other beneficial compounds in this gummy product will need to travel through the digestive tract before being absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on bioavailability factors, including height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and CBD tolerance. The calming CBD effects can last for as long as six to eight hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors.</p>
<p>Store your CBD Mushroom Gummies at room temperature, away from light (in a drawer or cupboard) as direct light may degrade the product over time.</p>
<p>Please be advised that our gummies do not contain “<strong>magic mushrooms</strong>,” which are psychedelic shrooms containing the compound, psilocybin.</p>
<h2>Shopping for the Best CBD &amp; Mushroom Products</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, every product we sell is made with CBD derived from organic hemp. This means you won’t have to worry about pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins making their way into your gummies. And that CBD oil is extracted from the hemp plant with clean, efficient carbon dioxide, which doesn’t leave behind any potentially harmful residues, as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and the potency of your CBD Mushroom Gummies by checking the <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (<strong>COA</strong>), which is a third-party lab report we provide for every product we sell. This report will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any toxins. At CBDfx, your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns!</p>

Together, these two potent cannabinoids make a perfect choice for those looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>

<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially derived from the buds (flower), leaves, and stalks of the cannabis <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the chemical compounds of the plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, and flavonoids. In addition to CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cannabinoids</a>, full spectrum CBD also contains small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeostasis</a>, or balance, in several vital systems and organs. Most notably, this includes the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. The interaction between CBD and the ECS assists the various organs and systems in regulating several important functions, such as sleep, immunity, mood, memory, motor control, appetite, stress relief, pain processing, and more. This produces a wealth of health benefits and is the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Full spectrum CBD</strong> oil, which is the oil used in our <strong>Delta-9 THC Gummies</strong>, is particularly beneficial, as it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Delta-9 THC (<strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids can produce multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis connoisseurs tend to associate sativa strains with mood enhancement, feelings of exhilaration, and bursts of creativity. This uplifting feeling works wonderfully with the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> can have calming effects for the mind and for the body. Delta-9 THC also has deeply relaxing qualities, making this cannabinoid combo perfect for long, unwind-the-mind “chill” sessions.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>As noted, CBD interacts with receptors in the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several important organs and systems. THC also carries a host of health and wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, pain and stress relief, antioxidant and immunity benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the oil that’s initially extracted from the leaves, buds, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust extract includes health-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabis compounds are taken together, rather than simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is referred to as the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many people who use CBD prefer full spectrum CBD oil products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>) is the compound in cannabis that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana. That is to say, it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids, which means there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis. Delta-8 and delta-10 THC also have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC.</p>
<p>While tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high if you take enough of it, delta-9 also has several health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, sleep support, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these limited-edition gummies) only contain THC that was derived from hemp. All of the products in this collection (and on this site) are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the US legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>As noted above on this page, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects via the phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. And in a product like our Pumpkin Spice THC Gummies, which feature 30mg of CBD and 10mg of THC per serving, that means your two major cannabinoids will work in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, delivering a deeper cannabinoid experience to you.</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis plants as, simply, sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have divided cannabis into three groups: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when consumed. The properties of sativa have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Pumpkin Spice Sativa Gummies are formulated to share these effects, but are compliant with legal THC limits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product sold by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, delta-9 THC, and mushroom products (including high-potency Pumpkin Spice Delta-9 THC Gummies) is free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This oil has been extracted from the hemp by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC, and mushroom products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking lab reports</a>, which accompany every product on the CBDfx website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report, which is called a <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (COA). COAs are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. They allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. Your safety and satisfaction are our top priorities!</p>
<p><em>Warning: This product may cause psychotropic effects.</em></p>
<div class="hub-drug-tests-notice col-12 p-4" style="border:1px solid red"><strong>Ingesting or inhaling products that contain delta-9 THC could result in the consumer failing a drug test for marijuana.</strong></div>

This soothing cream combines broad spectrum CBD with the powerful cannabinoid, CBG, in an optimal 1:1 ratio. In addition, we include a bevy of natural pain relievers, including white willow bark, caffeine, and tea tree oil, as well as the antioxidant &#38; anti-inflammatory powerhouse, vanillin. Finally, this potent CBG &#38; CBD topical product contains camphor, which warms and loosens muscles, bringing you quick and effective relief for aches and pains.

We also offer our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/">Muscle &#38; Joint Cream with a Cooling Formula</a> for icy relief of aches and pains.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As with any topical CBD product, simply rub the cream into the area affected by discomfort. Depending on the size of the area, you can start with anywhere from a dime-size to a quarter-size dollop of CBD body lotion. Make sure to rub it into the entire area affected by pain or discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because this product is a topical cream, it should only take about 10 to 20 minutes for you to begin feeling the effects. And because hemp-derived CBD is non-toxic, you can comfortably reapply it multiple times. </span><b>Often, you’ll see the best results when you apply your CBD cream three or four times a day.</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Benefits of CBD Lotion for Muscle &amp; Joint: Heating Formula</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CBDfx </span><b>CBD cream</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is formulated to relieve </span><b>muscle and joint pain</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Our </span><b>CBD muscle cream</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> begins with </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, derived from organic, USA-grown </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. We add to this a hearty dose of cannabigerol (</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), commonly referred to as the “Mother of All Cannabinoids,” plus several natural pain relievers, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/white-willow-bark-and-other-natural-pain-relievers/"><span style="font-weight: 400">white willow bark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, caffeine, and tea tree oil. We also use natural vanillin, which has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Last, but not least, our </span><b>CBD cream for pain</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> contains camphor, which naturally warms and loosens your muscles, bringing quicker and deeper relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This organic hemp cream comes in your choice of two potencies: 1000mg </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">/1000mg CBG, or high potency 3000mg CBD/3000 mg CBG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This </span><b>CBD hemp cream</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> offers an effective, natural alternative to sports creams, which are often made with chemical perfumes and additives, which can be ineffective, clog your pores, and leave a strong, unpleasant scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For centuries, people have used </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-inflammation/"><b>CBD for inflammation</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-latest-research-on-using-cbd-for-pain-relief/"><b>CBD for pain</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Despite this long history of topical use, we cannot legally make medical recommendations for the use of CBD for arthritis, injuries, or other medical issues. If you have a medical issue, please consult with your physician. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How Do CBD Topical Products Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While most </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> products, such as </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> edibles, CBD vapes, and sublingual CBD oils, are absorbed through the bloodstream and then released into your body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, CBD heating cream is a topical CBD product. CBD topicals allow the CBD to be absorbed through the skin and directly into the affected area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using CBD creams is simple. Just rub the hemp cream into the affected area and let it work.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Pros &amp; Cons of CBD Lotion</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Water-based topical products, like this organic CBD cream, can more easily travel through the different layers of the skin and reach affected areas than CBD balms or salves, which largely stay on the surface. So, for deep tissue relief, CBD creams are ideal products. For skin care, CBD balms are often preferred products.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Are CBG Lotions?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As mentioned, CBG is short for cannabigerol, which is one of the many compounds that exist in the cannabis plant, called cannabinoids. In fact, CBG is often referred to as the “Mother of All Cannabinoids,” because its acidic form (CBGA) is a precursor for CBD and many other cannabinoid compounds. Enzymes within the hemp plant interact with CBGA to create CBD, CBN, and other cannabinoid compounds. While CBG only exists in very small amounts in hemp, we’ve maxed out the CBG dosage in this cream to give you a remarkable 1:1 ratio with the CBD! That means you can enjoy maximum CBG wellness benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like CBD and other cannabinoid compounds, CBG mimics the body’s own endocannabinoids, which work with receptors in various systems and organs of the body and help them to maintain balance, or homeostasis. This interaction produces a wealth of wellness benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When multiple hemp compounds are ingested together, they actually bolster each other’s effects through a phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. So, in addition to CBG’s own wellness benefits, it also helps to make your CBD work harder for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CBG makes a powerful addition to any topical pain cream. Cannabigerol has anti-inflammatory benefits, like CBD, and also has been shown to have analgesic properties, meaning that it is effective in reducing pain. Research is still ongoing with this potent cannabinoid, but already it has become a highly sought-after pain cream ingredient. Try our CBD cream today and experience it for yourself!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Other Natural Ingredients in Our CBD Hemp Cream</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-pain/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD pain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> cream is vegan and cruelty-free, and is made from natural ingredients. The major active ingredients are hemp-derived </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, CBG, white willow bark, caffeine, tea tree oil, vanillin, and camphor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White willow bark has been used for millennia as a natural pain reliever. The active ingredient in white willow bark is salicin, which converts to salicylic acid in the body before it acts to lower the levels of certain compounds found to contribute to aches, pains, and inflammation. Unsurprisingly, salicylic acid is the active ingredient in aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Caffeine is more than just an energy booster: it can also help with pain management. Caffeine actually blocks adenosine receptors that influence pain signaling, and blocks peripheral adenosine receptors, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tea tree oil has properties that kill certain bacteria and trigger white cell production, which can help prevent infection and promote healing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vanillin — yes, from the vanilla bean itself — is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Camphor is commonly used to warm and relax muscles. This sensation not only distracts the mind from the pain source, but it also helps relieve tension that contributes to the pain itself.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why Is CBDfx CBD Cream the Best CBD Muscle Cream?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, we only use organic CBD, with oil culled from </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-hemp-good-for-the-planet/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> plants grown in the rich soil of Kentucky, to make our products.

					<description><![CDATA[Our OG Kush Indica Vape Juice is designed to give you all the relaxing properties of a good cannabis indica, but with legally compliant levels of delta-9 THC. The restful THC properties of this delicious vape e-liquid are delightfully complemented with the calming wellness effects of full spectrum CBD, evoking relaxed memories of this classic cannabis strain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: OG Kush Indica</h2>
<p>Our <strong>CBD + Delta-9 THC OG Kush Indica Vape Juice</strong> delivers powerful relaxation effects for the mind and body. Capturing the deeply calming aspects of the legendary cannabis strain OG Kush, this <strong>THC e-liquid</strong> gives you the distinct flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal THC limits set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD takes those effects to the next level. And with a <strong>THC vape juice</strong> product, you can feel these benefits almost immediately!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of CBD</a> (cannabidiol) for the body and mind have made it an incredibly popular wellness supplement. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially notable with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp’s health-boosting compounds, including all <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/"><strong>Delta-9 THC</strong></a> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes greatly to both the health and wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also delivers deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these cannabinoids make a potent combination to help you get the rest and sweet “chill” you desire.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the initial oil extract culled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This robust CBD oil contains all of the wellness-boosting chemical compounds of cannabis hemp, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. Hemp contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a>, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and non-intoxicating trace amounts of delta-9 <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%).</p>
<p>While hemp can legally contain up to 0.3% THC in the US, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal threshold. Knowing that many people seek the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products. With these delta-9 products (including our OG Kush <strong>THC vape oil</strong>), we’ve added bonus THC to the full spectrum CBD oil to give you maximum legal delta-9 THC effects.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* is one of two major cannabinoids (the other being CBD) produced by the cannabis plant. This cannabinoid is different from delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9. Delta-9 THC does produce psychotropic effects, and if you take it in large enough quantities, tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high.</p>
<p>But delta-9 THC also produces several health and wellness benefits, including mood elevation, sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta-9 THC</a>* we use in our <strong>THC vape juices</strong> is derived from hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill. This <strong>THC e liquid</strong> is not a marijuana product.</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>Some folks in the scientific community classify all forms of cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa. Others disagree and consider sativa, ruderalis, and indica to be three distinct species. Cannabis enthusiasts, though, have traditionally separated these cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects they generate when consumed. Generally speaking, cannabis indica produces relaxation benefits for the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBD + THC OG Kush Vape Juice is formulated to deliver these benefits, while still legally compliant with the US 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx Delta-9 THC Vape Juice the Best You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>Every <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDfx</a> product is formulated with safety and effectiveness in mind. All of our products contain CBD oil culled from organically grown hemp plants. Hemp is well known for its bioaccumulative powers and can easily absorb toxins if grown in fields with pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals. So, for your safety, we always use organic hemp.</p>
<p>We extract the hemp oil from the plant with clean CO2, which doesn’t leave behind potentially harmful chemicals as some solvents do. By demanding safe practices in both farming and oil extraction, we provide our customers with the purest CBD products they can buy.</p>
<p>You can confirm the purity and potency of our products by checking the laboratory report we provide for every product. These <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab reports</a> are generated by an independent, third-party company, so you can trust them for accuracy and transparency.</p>
<p>At CBDfx, your safety and satisfaction are our top priorities!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on OG Kush Indica THC Vape Juice</h2>
<p>Our OG Kush <strong>THC Vape Liquid</strong> gives you maximum legal THC benefits in every tasty puff. Whether you’re looking for a heavy “chill” sesh or just a great night’s rest, you’ll love the effects of our OG Kush Vape!</p>
<div class="hub-drug-tests-notice col-12 p-4" style="border:1px solid red"><strong>Ingesting or inhaling products that contain delta-9 THC could result in the consumer failing a drug test for marijuana.</strong></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Pineapple Express &#8211; Hybrid</h2>
<p><strong>Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Vape Juice</strong> is an ideal blend of good vibes and gentle relaxation. Combining the mood elevation of a sativa with the deep chill feel of an indica, this hybrid <strong>THC vape liquid</strong> gives you a wonderfully balanced delta-9 THC vape experience, within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. When you vape with this potent <strong>THC e-liquid</strong>, you can feel the effects of the cannabinoids almost immediately and enjoy one of the most popular (and famous!) cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition, you also get all the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> (or cannabidiol) is renowned for the many <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> it delivers to the body and mind as a result of its interaction with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which is the term used for the initial extract culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of cannabis hemp, containing all of hemp’s <strong>cannabinoids</strong> (including CBD and THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids.</p>
<p>Like CBD, <strong>THC</strong> (or tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes positively to the wellness benefits associated with the ECS, plus it can also add mood enhancement and relaxation. It’s this combination of blissful benefits that’s particularly notable in cannabis hybrid strains, such as the famous Pineapple Express.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of the hemp plant. This robust oil contains all of the hemp plant’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in hemp, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small, non-intoxicating levels of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limit, however. Understanding that many customers seek the maximum legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection of products. With our Delta-9 THC line, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to full spectrum CBD to give you maximum THC effects allowed by law.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* (tetrahydrocannabinol) is one of two major cannabinoid compounds produced by the cannabis plant. Delta-9 should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are considered minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9 THC. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* does have psychotropic effects and if you take it in large enough quantities, delta-9 can get you high.</p>
<p>But THC also has many health and wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, and more. The tetrahydrocannabinol we use in our <strong>THC Vape Juices</strong> is not derived from marijuana, but is instead derived from cannabis hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, cannabis enthusiasts have classified the different types of cannabis based on the plant’s leaf shape and the effects it delivers for the user. In general, the effects of a cannabis sativa strain are considered to include mood elevation, creativity, and reduction in stress and anxiety. Cannabis indica strains are most known for their deep relaxation effects. Hybrid cannabis strains are created when growers mix a sativa with an indica (there are cannabis ruderalis hybrids as well, but mostly, hybrids refer to a combination of sativa and indica). Hybrids can deliver the most pleasing aspects of both cannabis types, which is why strains like Pineapple Express are so popular with cannabis users.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Vape?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vaping THC</strong></a>, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds is the quickest way to experience their effects. This is because the various cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of your lungs, which occurs much faster than if you were to take a CBD edible or sublingual CBD oil. When you <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-vaping-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vape THC or CBD</a>, you can feel the effects in just a few minutes (sometimes even seconds), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, CBD or THC tolerance, metabolism, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx THC Vape Juice the Best THC E-Liquid You Can Buy?</h2>

<h3>Finding It Difficult to Focus Lately?</h3>
<p>You aren’t alone.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance and expand, so are the daily distractions that we’re faced with. Whether it’s the water-resistant phone you take into the shower to listen to music, the phone you take to the bathroom to read articles, or the podcasts you listen to on the way home, we live in an era of constant content.</p>
<p>And to be frank, it’s difficult to disconnect—and when that happens we tend to overload our dopamine receptors to the point where we don’t want to do or focus on anything else but entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Need to write up a report due in 4 hours?<br />
</strong><em>“Let me just check the news one more time.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Got to meet up with your significant other for lunch?<br />
</strong>“I’ll just push the reservation back.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the problem?</p>
<p>When we overload our brains with various stimuli, we have a tendency to become a slave to them, robbing us of our focus, and making it more difficult to channel when we need it.</p>
<p>Not sure if you have a problem focusing on the task at hand?</p>
<p>Here are a few signs to look out for.</p>
<h3>Signs You Have a Hard Time Focusing</h3>
<p>We’ve all been there; a deadline is approaching but you <em>just</em> started rewatching <em>Breaking Bad</em> for the fifth time and want to watch a bit longer. An hour-long break turns to two, then six, then the next day, until you’re staring at a deadline that’s impossible to meet.</p>
<p>A few of the most common signs of concentration issues include&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of focus</li>
<li>Difficulty sitting still</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking clearly</li>
<li>Making careless mistakes</li>
<li>Inability to make decisions</li>
<li>Inability to perform complicated tasks</li>
<li>Lacking physical or mental energy to concentrate</li>
<li>Being unable to remember things that occurred a short time ago</li>
<li>Frequently losing things or difficulty remembering where things are</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that you know what to look for, it’s time to figure out the main culprit&#8230;</p>
<h3>Why Are We Losing Our Ability to Maintain Focus?</h3>
<p><strong>Overstimulation<br />
</strong>When you’re constantly being bombarded with options for entertainment—namely your phone—it’s hard not to opt for the easier distraction when facing a difficult task. Although this is human nature, overstimulation weakens your internal ability to say “no&#8221; to yourself and distractions. The solution? Back away from distractions and negative stimuli for an extended period of time to reset your dopamine levels.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Behavior Loops</strong><br />
Our brains are pretty miraculous, allowing us to continue to learn new skills and perspectives as we get older. However, the paths of our brains are strengthened by repetition, and when we make bad choices in behavior consistently, our brain defaults to those actions as the standard making them harder to unlearn.If you start your workday surfing the Internet instead of settling into your workload, you’re building bad behaviors that make focusing when you need it more difficult. The solution? Be aware of these actions, their consequences, and gradually try to change them.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking</strong><br />
This is a common one, we all want to get everything done at once. However, it’s been shown that for most people, multitasking is a terrible way to take on projects. Not only does it rob us of our focus by splitting it in multiple directions, but we also inadvertently train our brain to “start and stop.&#8221; The solution? Deep work. Set a timer that you will not break focus from your task for that allotted set of time. Stick to it and your ability to sit down and focus should improve.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s What Else You Can Do About It&#8230;</h3>
<p>Down a Pomegranate or Tropical CBD Focus Shot and get to work.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of things you can—and should—do to improve your focus for the long term, when you’re at work or school on the Monday after the weekend, a little extra energy and focus never hurt.</p>
<p>That’s why our Pomegranate and Tropical CBD Focus Shots are specifically formulated with calming CBD, energizing vitamins and nutrients, and finished with a delectable taste to make getting focused a delicious breeze.</p>
