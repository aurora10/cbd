										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping for CBD can be challenging. Beyond the myriad of CBD brands and products, there’s also the matter of the <strong>CBD oil</strong> itself being used in your gummies or tincture oil. It turns out, not all CBD is created equal. And the type of CBD oil being used in your product can have a huge impact on your overall CBD experience.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll take a deep dive into the most robust of all types of CBD oil: <strong>full spectrum CBD</strong>. We’ll look not only at what <strong>full-spectrum CBD</strong> is and how it might impact the experience you have with a particular product, but also we’ll explore CBDfx’s diverse line of <strong>full spectrum CBD products</strong> so you can find the product that works best for you. But first things first: What exactly is CBD oil?</p>
<h2>What Is CBD Oil?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1754350" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx tincture dropper mct oil" width="192" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg 192w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-654x1024.jpg 654w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-300x470.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-60x94.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" />CBD oil, or hemp oil, is the oil that is derived from the stalks, buds, and leaves of the cannabis hemp plant. This is not to be confused with hemp-seed oil, which doesn’t contain CBD or other cannabinoids. CBD oil, though, contains a rich blend of all the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids of the cannabis hemp plant.</p>
<h2>Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>Full-spectrum CBD is the initial extract from the hemp plant with no additional filtration. That means it contains all of the 100-plus cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and even trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% by law). This oil is also rich in terpenes (which give the hemp plant its scent and taste) and flavonoids (which give hemp its color). All of these chemical compounds, as well as those healthy fatty acids we mentioned) provide a wealth of health and wellness benefits.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1106319" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/full-spectrum.svg" alt="full spectrum" width="56" height="56" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 2048w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 56px) 100vw, 56px" />But the effects of these various compounds are more than merely the sum of their individual parts. It turns out that multiple cannabinoids, when taken together, actually bolster one another’s effects through a phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. So, when you take a product that contains full-spectrum CBD, you not only benefit from all the individual cannabinoids and other compounds, but you also get them to perform at peak power and effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Broad Spectrum CBD &amp; CBD Isolate</h2>
<p>We mentioned that full-spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC and, while it’s not enough THC to get you high, the presence of delta-9 can be a dealbreaker for some people. So, there are forms of CBD with the THC filtered out.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1106309" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg" alt="broad spectrum" width="56" height="56" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 2048w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 56px) 100vw, 56px" /></p>
<p><strong>Broad spectrum CBD</strong> is pretty much the same oil as full spectrum, only a filtration process takes place to remove the THC. This filtration also takes out a few of the other compounds in the process. Nevertheless, most of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids remain in the oil, giving you a CBD oil that is still quite robust and can deliver a solid, albeit slightly diminished Entourage Effect.</p>
<p><strong>CBD isolate</strong> is CBD with all other cannabis compounds removed, leaving you with a powder that’s 99% pure CBD. CBD isolate does not deliver the Entourage Effect, as it contains no complementary cannabinoids, but it does offer a flavorless, odorless form of CBD that can be useful for products, like vape oils or bath products, where the product designer can make use of a clean, open palette.</p>
<h2>Full-Spectrum CBD Products</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD products make use of that maximized assortment of cannabis compounds to offer the deepest cannabinoid experience possible. We’ve created a variety of full-spectrum products, so that you too can enjoy the full benefits of the Entourage Effect.</p>
<h3>Full-Spectrum CBD Capsules</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2149869 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-224x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle soft gel capsules  aug  " width="224" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-224x300.jpg 224w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-766x1024.jpg 766w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-768x1027.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-60x80.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-110x147.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-300x401.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022.jpg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a>While we do offer multiple broad-spectrum CBD capsules, we also have a full spectrum capsule that delivers a powerful CBD experience. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD Soft Gel Capsules</a> are available in your choice of 25 or 50mg CBD servings. The only other ingredients are coconut-derived MCT oil for improved absorption, and gelatin to form the capsules. These CBD Softgels are the perfect product for people who want to try full-spectrum oil without other ingredients to cloud the experience, making them ideal for managing stress or simply chilling out at the end of a long day.</p>
<h3>Full-Spectrum CBD Oil Tinctures</h3>
<p>Similar to our CBD Soft Gel Capsules, our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</a> delivers a potent full spectrum experience, but with a few restful additions. With strengths ranging from 1000mg to 6000mg CBD, you’ve already got a powerful dose of full-spectrum oil in this CBD oil tincture. But we’ve also added bonus CBN, known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” and a proprietary blend of restful terpenes, to give you a wonderful calming product, great for a relaxing “chill sesh” or an effective wind-down before bedtime.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum Delta 9 THC Products</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2149871 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle ultimatechill  mar  " width="221" height="223" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022.jpg 793w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-298x300.jpg 298w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-768x774.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-110x111.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-300x302.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></a>While the legal delta-9 THC limit for hemp products in the US is less than 0.3%, often the full-spectrum extract yields significantly less THC than that. Many CBD enthusiasts prefer to have the additional THC, for both relaxation purposes and for the health benefits of THC. For these people, we’ve created a line of full-spectrum CBD products with additional delta-9 THC, taking the THC level right up to the legal limit. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC</a> line offers a variety of max-THC products to choose from.</p>
<h4>CBD + THC Gummies</h4>

<p>Whatever full spectrum delta 9 product you choose, you can be assured you’re getting only the finest in organic hemp and all-natural ingredients when you shop with CBDfx.</p>
<h2>Shopping for Quality CBD</h2>
<p>When you’re shopping for CBD — whether it’s a full-spectrum product or not — it’s important to verify the purity and potency of your product. Make sure the CBD company you choose uses organic hemp for their CBD oils, and make sure that hemp oil was extracted with clean CO2, so there’s no possibility of potentially harmful solvent residues in your product.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and potency of your CBD product by looking for a third-party lab report, or Certificate of Analysis. This report will tell you how much CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids are in your product, and also alert you to the presence of any harmful chemicals. At CBDfx, we insist on these three criteria for every product we make. Your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns.</p>
<p>And when it comes to full spectrum hemp products, remember to start with a smaller dosage if this is your first time trying a product made with full spectrum CBD oil. Everyone’s bodies are different, so it’s important to be able to gauge how CBD full spectrum products affect you. We wish you health and happiness on your CBD journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a plant that’s been used by humans for thousands of years, for everything from rope and paper manufacturing to pain relief and other wellness benefits. It’s also suffered from a basic misunderstanding due to its unfair association with marijuana. The plant we’re talking about is, of course, <strong>hemp</strong>. And it’s not only a plant of historical significance; it’s also the source of the hottest health supplement of the past decade: <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBD</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>What Is Hemp?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1862757" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-300x178.jpg" alt="WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEMP AND MARIJUANA" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-hemp-good-for-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemp</a> is a form of the cannabis plant. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cannabis</strong></a> has been around for a long, long time. How long? Think dinosaurs-long. That’s right, the cannabaceae family dates back to the Cretaceous time period, with the oldest surviving fossils clocking in at 90 to 94 million years old!</p>
<p>Humans began domesticating these plants as far back as 12,000 years ago in East Asia. Some of cannabis’s early use was, as one might expect, for the mood-lifting effects associated with THC. And it was used for medicinal purposes, as well, including pain relief and sleep support. As a hearty stalk plant, cannabis came to be used to make rope, cloth, paper, and a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/7-things-you-might-not-realize-have-hemp-in-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other products</a>. It’s safe to say that cannabis has been an integral part of human civilization, though early 20th century laws in the US and beyond changed things for a number of years.</p>
<p>As the government cracked down on high-THC cannabis, commonly referred to as marijuana, low-THC <a href="https://cbdfx.com/seeds-to-space-a-history-of-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp</a> got caught in the crossfire. It wasn’t until the 2018 US Farm Bill that hemp was finally legalized at the national level.</p>
<p>So, how do we connect the dots from hemp to all those great <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-gummies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD gummies</a> and other wellness products people have been enjoying in recent years? Well, let’s start by taking a closer look at the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/6-weird-facts-about-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp</a> plant itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/trichomes-why-does-cannabis-produce-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1861759" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg" alt="Trichomes Why Does Cannabis Produce Cannabinoids" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Trichomes</strong></a> are tiny growths on the surface of the cannabis plant. They produce a wide range of compounds that protect the plant. These include <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cannabinoids</strong></a> (such as CBD and THC), terpenes, and flavonoids.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Terpenes</strong></a> give cannabis its flavor and scent. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Flavonoids</strong></a> give plants their color. Like terpenes and flavonoids, the 100-plus cannabinoid compounds also serve a wide variety of functions, including protection against insect predators, grazing animals, UV light, and inclement weather. These compounds also attract pollinators, thus perpetuating the species.</p>
<h2>What Are Cannabinoids?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, cannabis produces over a hundred cannabinoid compounds. The two most prevalent (or, “major cannabinoids”) are CBD (cannabidiol) and THC (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>). Marijuana is heavy on the THC and a bit lighter in CBD content. Hemp is the opposite: high in CBD and low in THC. In fact, there is so little THC in hemp (less than 0.3%) that it’s non-intoxicating. Minor cannabinoids include <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a> (cannabinol), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a> (cannabigerol), and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a> (cannabichromene), along with many others.</p>
<p>Each of these compounds has a unique effect on the endocannabinoid system, found in the bodies of all vertebrate animals. It turns out, we also create cannabinoids. Our internally generated cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, serve as neurotransmitters, communicating with receptors in various systems and organs throughout the body, helping them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This, in turn, helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as sleep, pain, stress, motor control, immunity, mood, memory, appetite, and more.</p>
<p>CBD, THC, and other plant-based cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) interact with these same receptors, when consumed, and help to support these very same functions. The wellness benefits that stem from this interaction are the reason that CBD has become such a popular health supplement.</p>
<h2>Extracting CBD</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBD oil</strong></a> is extracted from the stalks, leaves, and buds of the hemp plant. This is different from <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-difference-between-cbd-oil-hemp-seed-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp seed oil</a> which, of course, comes from the seeds. While the oil from hemp seeds is great for skin care, it does not contain the same health-boosting compounds as CBD oil (sometimes called hemp oil). The initial extraction contains all of those compounds, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids of the plant. This extract is called full spectrum CBD.</p>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law), many people prefer to have the THC filtered out. This filtered version is called broad spectrum CBD. Broad spectrum oil is still a robust oil, containing nearly all the other hemp compounds of full spectrum, and is the desired oil for many users.</p>
<p>Some people prefer to have all other hemp material removed, leaving only the CBD. This 99% pure CBD is called CBD isolate. It’s a flavorless, odorless powder that can be useful in products, like some vape and bath products that require a clean palette for the product designer.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Organic Farming &amp; Safe Oil Extraction</h2>
<p>Hemp is what’s known as a bioaccumulator, meaning that it sucks up pretty much everything from the soil that surrounds the plant. This can be great when it comes to absorbing nutrients. In fact, it’s this powerful absorption that makes it easy to grow hemp (and all cannabis) in a wide variety of climates.</p>
<p>However, when the surrounding soil contains pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, and other toxins, that can be a problem. Ultimately, all of those potentially harmful compounds will not only be absorbed into the plant, but they’ll also end up in the CBD oil that’s extracted from the plant and, yes, they’ll be right there in the CBD products made from that oil. So, it’s vital to find CBD companies who work with farmers using organic techniques to grow their hemp crops. It’s the only way to ensure the purity of your hemp oil.</p>
<p>It’s also important to know how the CBD oil was extracted from the hemp. Some companies use cheaper methods involving solvents, such as butane, for extraction. This can leave behind potentially harmful residues in the oil. Though it might cost a bit more, it’s worth it to find a company that uses carbon dioxide to remove the CBD from the hemp. CO2 doesn’t leave behind a residue and is actually more efficient in pulling the cannabinoids from the hemp. So, you get a more pure and potent product when you choose a brand that uses CO2 extraction.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and the potency of your product by looking for a Certificate of Analysis (COA), which is a lab report generated by an independent, third-party laboratory. This report will tell you how much CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as any potentially harmful compounds that may have found their way into the mix. Never purchase a hemp product that is not accompanied by a COA.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Cannabis has a long and colorful history, stretching all the way back to the days of the T.Rex. Though it was vilified for nearly a century, due to its association with marijuana, low-THC hemp has rebounded to become one of the hottest health supplements of the 21st century.</p>
<p>As you explore hemp products, make sure to keep in mind some of the tips we mentioned in this article. Look for products made from organically grown hemp, with the oil extracted by means of clean CO2, and accompanied by a Certificate of Analysis. This will allow you to find the purest and most potent products available — and ensure your safety and satisfaction!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you struggling to find the perfect gift for the athlete in your life? If so, you’ve landed on the right page! CBD makes an excellent gift for the athletes or workout warriors, especially if they’ve never tried it before! Come to find out, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-use-cbd-to-achieve-your-fitness-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding CBD to any pre- or post-workout routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or active sport makes a big difference in how fast your body recovers. But, of course, different sports call for different approaches, so let’s cover some of the most popular sports and workouts — and the CBD products best suited for that activity level. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Runners</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1965911" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg" alt="unwind mushroom,focus mushroom,mushroom tincture" width="244" height="265" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg 945w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-277x300.jpg 277w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-768x832.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-60x65.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-110x119.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-300x325.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021.jpg 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may not consider running a sport so much as it is a way of life. Still, some of the best athletes in the world hate running, for reasons most of us can relate to — your chest burns, and your legs tingle as the lactic acid builds. Overall, running is something you have to train your body to handle and excel at, so having </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-runners-benefit-from-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right CBD product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes this process much more manageable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent addition to a runner’s fitness routine because it contains an energizing yet relaxing blend of CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a match made in CBD heaven because CBG (“the mother of all cannabinoids”) is known to produce uplifting effects, while CBD gives calming mental focus and works to minimize muscle discomfort associated with running. Another effective pick-me-up for those early-morning runs is our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/">Focus Blend CBD Mushroom Tincture</a>, combining wellness-boosting CBD and energizing CBG, along with adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms, which serve to deliver energy, support immunity, and alleviate stress on the mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1804853 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-194x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle footcream mar " width="194" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-194x300.jpg 194w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-662x1024.jpg 662w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-768x1188.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-993x1536.jpg 993w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-1324x2048.jpg 1324w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-300x464.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-60x93.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-scaled.jpg 1655w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /></a>As one might imagine, runners deal with sore, tired, achy feet after running for hours on end when they train. So, if you’re shopping for a runner, consider adding our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Foot Cream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their stocking! This way, their feet can experience a calming, comforting retreat with 500mg of broad spectrum CBD paired with the natural, softening effects of shea butter and the detoxifying, therapeutic effects of aromatic lavender and tea tree oil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t mind training twice as hard when they know they have a product like this waiting in their gym bag!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Tennis Players</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennis is a full-body workout, running back and forth across the court while maintaining precise hand-eye coordination to hit the ball and immediately get back into position for your opponent’s next shot. All the while, you’re starting and stopping on a dime on a hard asphalt court!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2113034" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle.jpg" alt="cbdfx us bathbomb bundle" width="335" height="335" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a>Tennis can put incredible stress on the body — which is all the more reason the tennis player on your list will swoon over our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Bath Bombs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have two bath bombs to choose from: our Soothing CBD Bath Bomb with lavender and Hawaiian black salt and our Recharge CBD Bath Bomb with uplifting essential oils, like peppermint, eucalyptus, spearmint, and arnica to stimulate the senses and comfort aching muscles. And this year, we&#8217;ve added two new bath bombs to our collection: Hydrating Formula with mango and shea butter, and Calming Formula with chamomile and lemongrass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each formulation contains 200mg of CBD isolate, and they’re 100% organic and vegan. Not to mention, they don’t have any of those harsh chemical colorants that stain your tub!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Gym Rats</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason you see professional athletes </span><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a26788252/ice-bath-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">soaking in ice baths after an intense game</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These ice baths reduce inflammation and improve circulation. The right CBD product can give you much of the same benefits — if not more!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD topicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work well since they&#8217;re applied directly to the source of discomfort, and there’s plenty to choose from — CBD balms, lotions, bath soaks, and much more! These creams and lotions soak through the layers of skin and get right to the muscles and joints that are in need of soothing relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2148374" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle muscle joint group  aug  " width="299" height="413" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022.jpg 579w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-60x83.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-110x152.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-300x415.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a>CBD Balm Sticks are always a great choice, because they&#8217;re effective and easy to use. We have two mess-free formulations: the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-muscle-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle and Joint CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both formulations have a generous concentration range from 750mg to 3000mg CBD for those who need a little more to get the job done!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Muscle and Joint Cream: Cooling Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural anti-inflammatories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/white-willow-bark-and-other-natural-pain-relievers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white willow bark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and caffeine, followed up with menthol for an immediate cooling sensation that soothes sore, tired muscles — without that soul-jolting ice bath!</span></p>
<p>Our new <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/">CBG Muscle and Joint Cream: Heating Formula</a> delivers many of the same anti-inflammatories, along with a healthy boost of CBG and muscle-warming camphor — perfect for deep tissue relief.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery Is the Gift That Keeps on Giving!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After practice, workout, or a game, the athlete on your list will want to come home and unwind with our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a full spectrum tincture that contains a blend of helpful cannabinoids (CBD and CBN, to be exact). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” perfect for when you want to come home, loosen up, and unwind. Some like to use it before bed, while others prefer adding it to their </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/create-a-cbd-self-care-routine-in-3-simple-steps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-care routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a chill Sunday afternoon. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Yoga Lovers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While yoga isn’t technically a sport, it still wakes up muscles you haven’t used in quite some time. Yoga has picked up in popularity since the pandemic. People began to see the mental and physical benefits associated with stretching your muscles and calming your mind simultaneously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what kind of gift do you get for your yogi friends? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-turmeric-spirulina/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1897001 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-300x291.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle gummies womens mar " width="300" height="291" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-300x291.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-768x745.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-60x58.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-110x107.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We think they’ll enjoy our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-turmeric-spirulina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Gummies with Turmeric and Spirulina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they contain an abundance of wellness-boosting ingredients. Turmeric is one of the more well-known “superfood” ingredients that boasts some pretty impressive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It’s a great addition to any yogi’s fitness routine, because it reduces inflammation and discomfort within the joints, making it that much easier to transition into downward dog without your joints slowing the process. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does seasonal change bring on sad feelings that never seem to go away? </span><a href="https://cannalogue.ca/column/column/health/can-medical-cannabis-help-with-seasonal-depression/"><b>Seasonal depression</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is real. In fact, it’s estimated that 11 million Americans suffer from </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder"><b>Seasonal Affective Disorder</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or SAD. But what exactly is this disorder, and what causes these intense feelings to bubble up? Today, we’ll explore this seasonal health issue and we’ll explore ways that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><b>CBD</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be able to help you beat those </span><b>winter blues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder that occurs for some people at the same time every year. For most people, that time of year is fall and winter, when there’s less daylight and we generally spend less time outdoors. SAD is generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">characterized by elevated feelings of depression or anxiety. Warning signs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can include a constant state of being sad or cranky, fatigue, concentration problems, greater appetite and weight gain, the desire to be alone, and even suicidal thoughts. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2142242" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad.jpg" alt="sad" width="1000" height="335" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad.jpg 1000w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-300x101.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-768x257.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-60x20.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-110x37.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While research into this phenomenon is ongoing and we’re not certain of the exact causes of SAD, it’s believed that seasonal hormone changes are the biggest culprit. With less sunlight in the fall and winter, the brain makes less serotonin, which helps to regulate mood. When your serotonin levels are off, this can result in feelings of anxiety or depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a less common summer variation of SAD (often called, “</span><b>summer depression</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), as well, which is characterized by loss of appetite, insomnia, and weight loss.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) is one of a group of chemical compounds created by the cannabis plant, called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are over a hundred such compounds in cannabis, and CBD is one of the two most prevalent (along with THC). CBD products, such as those sold by CBDfx, are made with CBD oil derived from a type of cannabis called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which contains only trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1825459 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-300x178.jpg" alt="cbdfx us blog What is the Endocannabinoid System" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While cannabinoids, like CBD, generate a number of benefits for the plant, including warding away insect pests and grazing animals, these compounds also produce a number of beneficial effects for humans, as well as all vertebrate animals. This is due to CBD’s interaction with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><b>endocannabinoid system</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cell-signaling system that helps various organs and systems throughout the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This interaction helps the body to regulate a number of crucial functions, including mood, memory, appetite, sleep, pain, stress, motor control, immunity, and much more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Benefits of CBD Oil?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2142248" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-300x230.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product mondays nov  " width="300" height="230" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-300x230.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-768x590.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-60x46.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-110x84.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Because of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system and its resulting benefits, cannabidiol is used now for a variety of needs. First and foremost, CBD is often taken as a booster for overall health and wellness. This is why you’ll often find CBD in daily wellness products, like our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-mens-multivitamin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Multivitamin Gummies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CBD also has natural calming properties, which make it ideal for stress-busting products, such as </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Soft Gel Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those same calming properties make CBD an ideal ingredient in natural sleep aids, such as our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-night-capsules-900mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Night Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Sleep Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Among the most popular CBD topical products are our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Muscle &amp; Joint Cream: Cooling Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG + CBD Lotion for Muscle &amp; Joint: Heating Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-muscle-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Balm Stick for Muscle &amp; Joint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming &amp; Moisturizing CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can It Combat Seasonal Affective Disorder?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we discuss whether CBD can combat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), it’s worth noting that research on the effects of CBD are still ongoing and the FDA has not approved the use of CBD for medical purposes. So, this article should not be construed as medical advice for the use of CBD. What we can do is discuss some of CBD’s noted effects and see how they might apply to a person suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder or depression. If you are suffering from a serious physical or mental condition, please consult your physician.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1774309" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-741x1024.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle calmingtincture  mar  " width="301" height="416" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-741x1024.jpg 741w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-768x1062.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-300x415.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-60x83.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021.jpg 868w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a>As you were reading about CBD, you probably had a few “light bulb” moments, noting that CBD has been shown to affect the regulation of mood and stress. Indeed, the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calming effects of CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are wonderful for dealing with elevated nerves and stressful situations. While it’s certainly not a cure for depression, CBD can help relax your thoughts and relieve tension. This can be a useful tool if you’re dealing with SAD, along with increased time outdoors in the daylight (or artificial light therapy), vitamin D, and exercise. And again, if you are experiencing severe depression, please consult a medical professional.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can be debilitating if that depression lingers for an extended amount of time. If you think you’re suffering from SAD, the first step is to consult a medical professional. And consider ways to remove or reduce stress in your life. CBD is a great soother of nerves and could be useful if you’re dealing with SAD or just plain old anxiety. Try one of our best-selling CBD oil stressbusters today!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re probably here because you’re already familiar with </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and maybe even its less famous cousin, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg-your-ultimate-guide-to-cbg-vs-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Perhaps, you’ve even dipped your toe into the pool of legal THC products, as well. Now, you’re seeing the term </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2019/07/30/cbn-is-another-cannabis-compound-with-beneficial-properties/?sh=5088a9ef1d9b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pop up in various health products and, perhaps, you’re starting to get confused, annoyed, or both. </span><b>What is CBN</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyway? Why does the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry throw around so many terms and abbreviations? This whole thing is starting to look like a bowl of alphabet soup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’ll take an in-depth look at </span><b>CBN</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ll look at what CBN is, its various effects and health benefits, and how this relative of CBD and </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used in cutting-edge hemp products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To best understand what CBN is, we’ll first need a quick refresher on what CBD is, and what cannabinoids are, in general. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Cannabinoids: How Is CBN Produced?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1754350" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx tincture dropper mct oil" width="141" height="220" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg 192w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-654x1024.jpg 654w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-300x470.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-60x94.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><b>Cannabinoids</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are molecular compounds produced by the </span><b>cannabis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant. Cannabis creates these compounds to serve several purposes, including warding away insect predators and grazing animals, protecting the plant from harsh weather, and attracting pollinators. There are around </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">113 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known in the cannabis plant, with the two most famous cannabinoids being </span><b>cannabidiol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or CBD, and </span><b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-101-cbd-vs-thc-whats-the-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD and THC are also the two cannabinoids that appear in the greatest quantities in cannabis, which is why they are referred to as the “major cannabinoids.” CBD is non-psychoactive (it doesn’t cause a high) and carries with it a number of health benefits, some of which we’ll discuss in a moment. Delta-9 THC is psychoactive and does cause a high … hence all the laws and regulations. Here at CBDfx, we use the low-THC form of cannabis, known as hemp, to create all of our legal CBD and delta-9 THC products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are other cannabinoids, as well, which occur in lesser quantities and are known as “minor cannabinoids.” These include CBG, CBC, and the star of this article, CBN (</span><b>cannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Do Cannabinoids Do?</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1612475 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg" alt="what is cbd endocannabinoids system" width="260" height="154" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabinoids interact with our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a series of chemical receptors closely integrated with our central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as systems that regulate digestion, sleep, and more. Humans and all other vertebrate animals have an endocannabinoid system, including our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/do-your-pets-have-an-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dogs and cats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a cannabinoid, like CBD or CBN, interacts with an endocannabinoid system receptor, it imparts specific therapeutic benefits, depending on what that specific receptor does and what that cannabinoid’s properties are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/seeds-to-space-a-history-of-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the history of humans using cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stretches back for millennia, and scientists have been studying it for more than a century, much of what happens when cannabinoids interact with our bodies is still a mystery. While scientists continue to study the effects of multiple cannabinoids for uses including epilepsy, pain relief, and anxiety, the research is ongoing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1826892" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-1024x213.jpg" alt="cbn" width="640" height="133" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-1024x213.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-300x62.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-768x160.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-60x12.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-110x23.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-1536x320.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbn-2048x426.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBN?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s interesting to note that, even though CBN is far less known than CBD, it’s actually the very first cannabinoid ever to have been isolated in the cannabis plant. CBN was first isolated </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1760722/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the late 1800s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By the 1930s, scientist R.S. Cahn was studying CBN in depth, and soon scientists were synthesizing this cannabinoid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is short for cannabinol. CBN is actually formed by the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cannabinol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breakdown of THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over time, often because of oxidation or heat. In fact, CBN was probably first identified in the 1800s because of poor storage of cannabis during transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But CBN is hardly a weaker version of THC, as one might think. While the powerful psychoactive features of THC are long gone by the time CBN comes onto the scene, there are a </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201908/research-shows-9-potential-health-benefits-cbn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multitude of great health benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that take their place.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBN</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-1847736" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--300x300.jpg" alt="WHAT DOES CBN DO " width="250" height="250" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO--100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WHAT-DOES-CBN-DO-.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, the research on CBN, CBD and other cannabinoids is ongoing and the FDA wisely cautions against making definitive medical claims. That said, we know </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-vs-cbn#cbn-benefits-uses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what people use CBN for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how cannabinol works for them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, people have depended on the calming effects of CBN to help them get a good night’s rest. CBN binds with receptors in the brain, and seems to promote calm and sleepiness. In fact, many people buy CBN products strictly for sleep support. Often, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is combined with CBD and other calm-promoting ingredients, such as melatonin and certain terpenes, for products designed to enhance sleep, as well as promote calmness and ease stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN works most powerfully in combination with other cannabinoids to produce the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/so-whats-the-entourage-effect-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the effect created when multiple cannabinoids (such as CBD and CBN) work synergistically, creating an overall effect stronger than what any single cannabinoid would produce on its own.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Use CBN: A Guide to Cannabinol Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full spectrum CBD or broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you already have some experience with CBN. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids found in the cannabis plant, including the legally allowed amount of less than 0.3% THC. Broad spectrum CBD filters out that tiny amount of THC and, in the process, a few of the other cannabinoids are filtered from the CBD oil, as well. Both full spectrum CBD and broad spectrum CBD products contain CBN. (CBD isolate, on the other hand, contains no cannabinol, nor any other hemp content beyond CBD.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some CBD products, generally formulated for relaxation or rest, with bonus CBN added to the oil, so the user can feel the pronounced effects of cannabinol. Let’s look at a few of the best CBN products on the market today, made with pure, organic hemp oil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1897043" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/collection-mushroom-img-hdr-1-300x217.png" alt="collection mushroom img hdr" width="300" height="217" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/collection-mushroom-img-hdr-1-300x217.png 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/collection-mushroom-img-hdr-1-60x43.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/collection-mushroom-img-hdr-1-110x79.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/collection-mushroom-img-hdr-1.png 753w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We’ve used mushrooms as medicine since Neolithic times, going as far back as 10,000 BCE. In fact, the 4,000-year-old mummy Ötzi, or the Iceman, was found to have an antibiotic mushroom in his medical kit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 450 BCE, the Greek physician Hippocrates (namesake of the Hippocratic Oath that doctors take today), used the amadou mushroom as an anti-inflammatory. Indigenous peoples in North America used puffball mushrooms to heal wounds, and the 5th century Chinese alchemist Tao Hongjing wrote about the power of multiple types of mushroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In every culture across the globe, mushrooms and fungi have been a treasured source of health and medicine for thousands of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, before you begin to think of mushroom medicine as just the stuff of history and folklore, it’s valuable to remember that many important medicines we use today are derived from fungi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This includes penicillin (from the fungus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">penicillium notatum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">), the anti-cancer therapeutic Krestin (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tramates versicolor, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">or turkey tail, which we’ll talk about more below</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and the drug Cyclosporine, used to prevent organ rejection after transplants (two fungi, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">trichoderms polysporum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">cylindrocarpon lucidum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">).</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> And those are just a few examples of the medical power of mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Western science, unfortunately, often overlooks indigenous and traditional medicines. Fortunately, an overwhelming number of studies into mushrooms show that the polysaccharides and triterpenes in mushrooms illustrate their immense medical and adaptogenic properties — something that our ancestors already knew. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For generation upon generation, we have relied on mushrooms and fungi for hundreds of uses, including fighting stress, infection, inflammation, and fatigue — as well as providing vitamin content in our diet. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Adaptogenic Mushrooms for Health &amp; Wellness</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we talk about using mushrooms for wellness applications, we need to understand the difference between medicinal mushrooms and adaptogenic mushrooms. Medicinal mushrooms possess properties that have specific medicinal applications, like anti-inflammatory or antibacterial use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While some adaptogenic mushrooms do double duty as medicinal mushrooms, the term “adaptogenic” refers to another set of incredibly valuable properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adaptogens have the potential to dramatically reduce the effects of stress on our bodies — physical, chemical, and biological stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The term comes from the Latin word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">adaptare, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">meaning to adapt or adjust. It was coined by the Russian scientist Nikolai Lazarev in the 1940s when he came across the potential of adaptogenic substances to reduce stress on the bodies of athletes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confirming what the global cultures we mentioned above have known for millennia, much adaptogenic research since Lazarev has focused on the benefits of specific mushrooms, including </span><b>chaga</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>cordyceps</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>lion’s mane</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>maitake</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>reishi</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, <strong>shiitake</strong>, and </span><b>turkey tail</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushroom. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">How Do Adaptogenic Mushrooms Work?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignright wp-image-1897051 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-445x1024.jpg" alt="endocannabinoid system" width="190" height="437" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-445x1024.jpg 445w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-130x300.jpg 130w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-768x1766.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-60x138.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-110x253.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-668x1536.jpg 668w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-300x690.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" />Adaptogens interact with the body’s primary stress response system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis).</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This is the interaction between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The HPA axis, much like the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, also helps regulate processes like digestion, mood, and immune response. It also influences the release of cortisol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adaptogens influence the HPA axis when it is stimulated by stress, helping our bodies return to homeostasis, or balance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The polysaccharides and triterpenes in mushrooms do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to adaptogenic work. Polysaccharides, like beta glucan, have been shown to enhance immune response</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and triterpenes can help with mood in addition to supporting biological responses, like blood pressure and perhaps even pain response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Triterpenes may sound familiar to you </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> fans. That’s because they’re a type of compound called a terpenoid that is closely related to the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> we look for in </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Triterpenes and terpenes are a little different from one another (terpenes are hydrocarbons, while terpenoids come about through the oxidation of terpenes), but they are just as valuable in their adaptogenic potential, </span>while medicinal mushrooms have been used for overall wellness and to treat all kinds of ailments for hundreds of years, it needs to be stated that most of the studies that have been conducted were very small human studies or in animals. These fungi have huge potential health benefits, but more research is definitely needed.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Adaptogenic Mushrooms: The Star Players</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are around 14,000 known species of mushrooms, and that’s considered to be only 10% of the mushrooms that are estimated to exist here on Earth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Some have medicinal properties, some are poisonous, and some make for a nice salad recipe when they’re dried out. So, needless to say, we need to do some narrowing down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s look at the most popular mushrooms with adaptogenic properties. You could say any one of these is the fungi you want to bring to the party (sorry, we couldn’t resist).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Cordyceps</span></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897065 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi cordycepts" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-cordycepts-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Cordyceps sinensis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a type of fungus known for its potential to reduce stress on the body, in part by increasing our resistance to stress-inducing activity. Cordyceps is often used for an energy boost. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Chaga</span></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897066 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi chaga" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-chaga-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Inonotus obliquus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> gets its nickname, chaga, from a medieval Russian prince who purportedly took it to treat his lip (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gaga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) cancer … or so the story goes. We certainly don’t make any claims about the use of chaga for any serious disease, but we can tell you that the chaga mushroom has been relied upon for centuries to help with immunity and overall health.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Lion’s Mane</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897067 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi lionsmane" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-lionsmane-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hericium erinaceus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushroom gets its nickname from its shaggy appearance. This mushroom has also traditionally been taken for its adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and inflammation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Reishi</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897068 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi reishi" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />G</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anoderma lucidum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushrooms are believed to help support the adrenal glands, which in turn release cortisol to help the body respond to stress. In China, this mushroom is known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ling zhi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, which translates roughly to “spiritual plant.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Maitake</span></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897069 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi maitake" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-maitake-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />The grifola frondosa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushroom </span><span style="font-weight: 400">has been called the “dancing mushroom” (maitake) because it was so valuable in feudal Japan that people danced for joy when they found some. It’s nutrient-rich and beloved for its positive immunity and wellness benefits. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Turkey tail </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-1897070 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1-150x150.png" alt="fungi turkeytail" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-turkeytail-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">trametes versicolor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushroom gets the name “turkey tail” (also “turkeytail”) from its colorful, fan-like shape. This mushroom is well known for its immune properties, and it contains two different polysaccharopeptides, which have powerful immune benefits. It’s also packed with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiitake</span></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lentinula edodes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a brown-capped mushroom that hails from East Asia and is chock full of essential vitamins and minerals. Shiitake has long been valued for its immunity, heart health, antibacterial, adaptogenic, and nootropic benefits — all of which makes it a wonderful, well-rounded wellness supplement.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Psilocybin and Magic Mushrooms</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slow your roll, Timothy Leary. The adaptogenic mushrooms in our products are not psychedelic “shrooms.” They won’t make you hallucinate, and they won’t get you high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’re not “magic mushrooms.” None of the fungi in our CBD mushroom products contain psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound that people use for recreational purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our products aren’t designed for intoxicating effects. Rather, we’re interested in wellness benefits — helping mood and overall health, and contributing to a healthy lifestyle.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Mushrooms for the Mind: Nootropics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1897054" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-300x262.jpg" alt="Nootropics" width="300" height="262" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-300x262.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-768x670.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-60x52.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-110x96.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In addition to their adaptogenic properties, certain mushrooms — like lion’s mane, cordyceps and chaga — have the potential to provide even more value to our holistic health as nootropics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A nootropic is a substance that is believed to enhance cognitive function. Although we originally used the term for chemical pharmaceuticals designed specifically for a brain boost (Adderall, donepezil), the definition has since expanded to include natural supplements — including mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">How could a nootropic help with brain function? There are a few ways: by stimulating the repair and growth of new nervous system cells, fighting brain cell inflammation, maximizing oxygen use in brain and nervous tissue, and supporting mood and sleep, which is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/do-you-need-to-reset-your-sleep-patterns/"><span style="font-weight: 400">absolutely vital for brain health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s great potential in the use of mushrooms for their nootropic benefits alone, much less when supported by their adaptogenic and medicinal properties.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How Are These Mushrooms Grown?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, mushrooms are very good at absorbing everything in the environment where they grow. This includes heavy metals, chemicals, and toxins. At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, we choose clean, organic, American-grown mushrooms that are wild harvested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our adaptogenic mushrooms are extracted from the sporocarp, or fruiting body, of the fungi. We extract the mushroom content for our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> mushroom products with a clean water spraying method. This means you’re getting the purest and most potent mushroom extract available, with no potentially harmful, residual chemicals.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the age-old question in cannabis products: tinctures or edibles? Both types of products have their pros and cons, but is one better than the other? Today, we’ll explore the world of </span><b>delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including its many benefits, and we’ll take a long look at the variety of legal cannabis products available in the US. By the end of this article, you’ll have a better understanding of </span><b>THC edibles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and oils, and you’ll also learn some tips on how to find the best </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CBD products in terms of purity and potency, so that you can purchase with confidence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2130582" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-1024x984.jpg" alt="d icon" width="170" height="163" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-1024x984.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-300x288.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-768x738.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-60x58.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-110x106.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" />To understand delta-9 products, it’s important to first understand just what </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of a group of compounds that come from the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, which are called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Delta-9 is one of two “major cannabinoids” (along with CBD), which are called so because they occur in high quantities in the plant. There are also over a hundred minor cannabinoids, such as CBG and CBN, which occur in very small quantities, but can have beneficial effects, as well. Cannabis also produces health-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but let’s concentrate on those major cannabinoids: delta-9 and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ratios vary, depending on the type of cannabis you’re dealing with. Tetrahydrocannabinol occurs in very high concentrations in the type of cannabis we generally refer to as marijuana. Low-THC hemp, on the other hand, contains high concentrations of CBD (cannabidiol). Each of these cannabinoids has different properties, which yield differing effects on the mind and body. But they share in common the ability of nearly all cannabinoids to interact with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This cell-signaling system is interconnected with receptors in various organs and systems throughout the body. The body creates its own cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, which interact with these receptors and help those various organs and systems to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This, in turn, helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as sleep, pain suppression, stress relief, appetite, mood, memory, motor control, and much more. Plant-based cannabinoids, when consumed, mimic the body’s own endocannabinoids in delivering these benefits. CBD is particularly effective in helping the body maintain balance, which is why it has become such a popular wellness product. But delta-9 has many wellness benefits, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of the Cannabinoid, Tetrahydrocannabinol</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1868150" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-300x178.jpg" alt="What Is THC A Guide to Tetrahydrocannabinol" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Let’s begin with the obvious: Tetrahydrocannabinol is the cannabinoid in marijuana that’s famous for getting you high. We mentioned that the benefits of cannabinoids stem from their interaction with the endocannabinoid system, affecting various bodily functions. Well, THC can go a bit overboard in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elevating your mood, sometimes boosting your appetite (got munchies?), affecting your motor control abilities, and so on. These are the reasons people generally use marijuana, to accentuate those effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in lower dosed hemp, THC can bring with it a host of wellness benefits, as well as powerful relaxation effects. People have used cannabis for millennia to take advantage of delta-9’s ability to calm nerves and ease stress. The calming properties of THC can help release tension in your muscles, which may also help with cramping and similar issues. Delta-9 can also elevate your mood, making bedtime or any “chill” session extra blissful. THC has been shown to have antihistamine and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">antioxidant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits, as well, and can help prevent nausea. And (especially with indica cannabis strains) this potent cannabinoid can deliver wonderful sleep-supporting effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Cannabis Edibles?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2120299" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-300x164.jpg" alt="The Classic Edibles Mistake and How Not to Make It" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-768x419.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-60x33.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-110x60.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-2048x1117.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />CBD and delta-9 cannabis edibles are simply products packed with a particular cannabinoid (or cannabinoids), that are consumed by eating or drinking. This means that the cannabinoid in question must pass through the digestive tract in order to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Popular cannabis edible products include CBD or delta-9 gummies, capsules, pills, cookies, brownies, drinks, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Cannabis Oil Tinctures?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinctures are oil products that are taken by using a dropper. Technically, tinctures are edibles if you simply swallow them or add them to a drink or food. In the case of this type of consumption, the oil cannabis tincture will need to travel through your digestive tract before you feel its effects. Generally, though — for reasons we’ll set forth below — tinctures are meant to be taken sublingually (under the tongue). In this way, the CBD or delta-9 cannabinoid is absorbed through the capillaries of the mouth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits &amp; Effects of Tinctures Versus Edible Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-2130590 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle THC group  mar  " width="330" height="203" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-300x184.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-768x471.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-60x37.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-110x68.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" />In comparing tinctures and edibles, the tincture can have much faster-acting effects than edibles. This is because, when you take tinctures, the cannabis content doesn’t have to travel all the way through your digestive tract before being absorbed into your bloodstream. A sublingual tincture can deliver cannabis compounds into your bloodstream, generally speaking, in 15 to 30 minutes. We say “generally speaking,” because everyone’s body works differently and we all have differing </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioavailability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors that affect the way we absorb CBD and delta-9. These factors can include height, weight, metabolism, CBD or delta-9 tolerance, and more. As we say, compared to tinctures, edible products can take longer for you to feel the effects, generally 30 minutes to two hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like a no-brainer, then, to take tinctures vs cannabis edibles. You do generally feel the effects of a tincture quicker than an edible, after all. However, the effects of an edible can last considerably longer than the effects of cannabis tinctures. The effects of an oil tincture can last roughly four to six hours, depending on (you guessed it) bioavailability factors. The effects of a CBD or delta-9 edible, on the other hand, can last six to eight hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/delta-9-thc-capsules-cbd-daily-chill-blend/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2120288" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-294x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle d soft gel capsules  aug  " width="210" height="214" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-768x784.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-60x61.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-110x112.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-300x306.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>So, it really comes down to how long you’re willing to wait for the effects of your cannabis product and how long you’d like those cannabis effects to last to determine whether cannabis oil drops or edibles are best for you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the Best Cannabis Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all cannabis products are created equally. In fact, many tinctures and edibles on the market are ineffective and even unsafe. So, it’s important to know what to look for when you’re shopping for cannabis tinctures and edibles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-gummies-berry-buzz-sativa/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2130592 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-207x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product THCgummies  may  " width="207" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-60x87.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-110x160.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-300x436.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022.jpg 551w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" /></a>First, make sure your CBD or delta-9 product is made with organic hemp, so there’s no likelihood that your oil or gummy contains pesticides, heavy metals, or other potentially harmful compounds that can be absorbed from the soil. And make sure the CBD oil was extracted by means of clean carbon dioxide, which won’t leave behind any potentially toxic residues, as can happen with some cheaper methods of oil extraction. The purity and potency of your product can be verified by checking that product’s Certificate of Analysis, which is a report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. This report will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any contaminants.</span></p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1842023" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-180x300.jpg" alt="what are Phytocannabinoids" width="180" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-180x300.jpg 180w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-613x1024.jpg 613w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-60x100.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-110x184.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-300x501.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids.jpg 719w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />Let’s start with a brief refresher on what exactly CBD is. Cannabidiol (CBD, for short) is one of a group of chemical compounds generated by the cannabis plant, called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>. There are over 100 of these cannabinoid compounds, with CBD and THC being the most abundant. As such, they’re generally referred to as the two “major cannabinoids.” The CBD in our products comes from hemp, a low-THC form of cannabis that won’t get you high, but will deliver a bevy of wellness benefits.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Work?</h2>
<p>Your body creates its own endocannabinoids, which are part of an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a> (ECS). The endocannabinoid system signals to receptors in various systems and organs throughout the body, helping them maintain homeostasis, or balance. In doing this, the ECS helps the body regulate such vital functions as appetite, immunity, sleep, pain, stress, memory, motor control, mood, and more.</p>
<p>When you consume CBD, it mimics your body’s endocannabinoids, and signals to those same organs and systems, helping your body maintain homeostasis and regulate all of those important functions. This generates a wealth of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> and is the reason CBD has become such a popular health supplement. It’s also the reason many people use <strong>CBD for workouts</strong>.</p>
<h2>CBD for Pre-Workout Energy &amp; Focus</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbg-morning-capsules-900mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2077677 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-300x164.jpg" alt="CBD Morning Products Optimize Your Morning" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-768x419.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-60x33.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-110x60.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CBD-Morning-Products-Optimize-Your-Morning-2048x1117.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One of CBD’s many benefits is a calming property that, interestingly enough, works well in morning or pre-workout energy products. Combined with the right energy-boosting ingredients, CBD can help to calm your mind without making you feel sluggish, giving you intense focus for your workouts.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbg-morning-capsules-900mg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD + CBG Morning Capsules</a> are a great <strong>CBD focus product</strong> to take before workouts.

Take two <a href="https://observer.com/2022/06/10-best-cbd-pills-cbd-capsules-of-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD capsules</a> about 60 minutes before exercising to experience the full focus effects.</p>

<h2>CBD for Post-Workout Recovery</h2>
<p>Recovery after your workout can be as important as the exercise itself. It’s crucial to heal as quickly as you can so you don’t lose your momentum. CBD can get you back in the grind in multiple ways.</p>
<h3>CBD for Pain</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2124456 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022-225x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product mjc heating  sep  " width="225" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022-60x80.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022-110x147.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022-300x400.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-mjc-heating-09-sep-23-2022.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>CBD helps soothe discomfort and stress that your body can experience after intense exercise.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Edibles</strong> are one of the most popular ways people enjoy the mood-elevating effects of <strong>delta-9 THC</strong>. And they come in a variety of forms. From <strong>THC gummies</strong> and <strong>THC capsules</strong> to <strong>THC cookies</strong>, <strong>THC brownies</strong> and more, there seems to be an endless selection of these blissful delta-9 treats. And with our hemp-derived delta-9 products, you can enjoy them legally, as well. So, what’s not to love?</p>
<p>Well, there is a classic mistake that many first-timers make when trying <strong>THC edibles</strong>. If you’re one of those looking to make the leap to delta-9 THC, the good news is that you’re on the right page. In this article, we’ll fill you in on what exactly THC edibles are, and clue you in on the mistake many users instantly regret making. We’ll tell you not only how to avoid it, but we’ll also clue you in on some of the <strong>best THC edibles</strong> on the market.</p>
<p>But first things first …</p>
<h2>What Are THC Edibles?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cookies-cbd-wedding-cake/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2120281 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-276x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle d cookies birthday cake  aug  " width="276" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-276x300.jpg 276w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-60x65.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-110x120.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-300x327.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022.jpg 734w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a>Perhaps it’s a bit obvious, but THC edibles are foods and drinks you can consume containing <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>. THC is a compound found in the cannabis plant. While it has a number of health benefits, THC is best known for the feeling it gives a user when that user has consumed it in greater quantities. That is to say, it’s the thing in cannabis that gets you high.</p>
<p>But not all THC comes from marijuana. There is a low-THC form of cannabis, called hemp, which is used to make a variety of products, from rope to paper — and, of course, legal CBD products. Hemp is regulated by the government under the 2018 US Farm Bill, which states that it can contain up to 0.3% THC. What savvy CBD brands have discovered is that the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, the oil as it is first extracted from the hemp plant, sometimes has considerably less THC than the legal limit allows. And so, we go back into the full spectrum oil and add bonus amounts of delta-9, taking it back up to the legal limit — giving you a maximum legal THC experience.</p>
<h2>What’s the Classic Edibles Mistake?</h2>
<p>Unlike sublingual oils or vape products, edibles must travel through the digestive tract before being absorbed into the bloodstream. Once the THC and other cannabinoids enter your bloodstream, you’ll begin to feel their effects. The part that trips some people up is that it can take a little longer for edibles to kick in than other forms of THC or CBD products. In fact, depending on <a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/">bioavailability</a> factors, such as height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the THC effects.</p>
<p>The classic edibles mistake is impatience. Countless first-timers can attest to getting antsy and thinking they didn’t take enough of their THC product. And so, they take a second or even third dose, in the hopes that things will kick in. Of course, once that first dose does kick in … and the second … and the third … the person can be in way over their head.</p>
<h2>How Can You Avoid It?</h2>
<p>Don’t over-consume. In fact, with your first THC edible, you should consider taking less than the recommended amount to get a sense of your own tolerance. If you wait a couple of hours and find that you’re not really feeling anything, then you’ll know that you can increase your dosage next time around. Not this time … <em>next</em> time. Gently raise your dosage each time out until you find the one that delivers the desired effects. Remember, everyone is different. So your ideal dose isn’t necessarily the same as someone else’s. Start low and gradually work your way up.</p>
<p>And remember, even though this is legal, hemp-derived THC, it can still cause psychotropic effects. So, don’t drive or operate heavy machinery after taking a THC edible.</p>
<h2>The Best THC Edibles You Can Buy</h2>

<h2>The Final Word on Edibles</h2>
<p>THC and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-guide-to-cbd-edibles-gummies-other-cbd-products/">CBD edibles</a> can be great. In fact, of all the types of hemp-based cannabinoid products, their effects last the longest (potentially six to eight hours!). Just make sure you understand that, just because you don’t feel an edible right away, it doesn’t mean those effects aren’t coming. Don’t get impatient and double dose. Just be cool and enjoy the ride!</p>
<p><strong>Thinking of trying THC edibles? Our </strong><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-gummies-berry-buzz-sativa/"><strong>Berry Buzz Sativa Delta-9 THC Gummies</strong></a><strong> are a great place to start!</strong></p>

Take your favorite drink recipe and add a drop or two of a CBD oil tincture to the mix, so that you can enhance your experience with the flavor and effects of this potent cannabis compound.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of CBD Drinks</h2>
<p>There are multiple benefits to <strong>CBD-infused drinks</strong>, which can vary depending on what kind of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> hemp extract you choose. All CBD oils come with a plethora of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">health benefits</a>, due to CBD&#8217;s interaction with the body&#8217;s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>. But there are certain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/">CBD tincture</a> products that are especially designed with wellness in mind. Other CBD hemp products are designed for sleep, making any <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-smoothie-recipes/"><strong>CBD-infused smoothie</strong></a> or drink a great evening beverage. And there are CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp</a> tinctures designed with blissful relaxation in mind.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take a quick look at our selection of different CBD oils so that you can choose the right bottle for your needs. But don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to those delicious, infused <strong>CBD drinks</strong> soon!</p>
<h2>How Are CBD Drinks Made? Choosing the Best CBD Oil</h2>
<p>We have a variety of CBD oils that vary not only in their effects, but also in their flavors. Before you start mixing your beverages, read closely to find the bottle of CBD tincture that works best for you!</p>

This popular CBD tincture contains organic, hemp-derived CBD, added CBG for energy, and the powerful antioxidants, curcumin and coenzyme Q10. The flavor of this CBD tincture is citrusy, with just a hint of turmeric. This natural hemp tincture mixes well with juices, smoothies, and most other breakfast or pre-workout beverages.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1905050" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-300x300.png" alt="cbd tincture focus mushroom" width="156" height="156" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-300x300.png 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-768x768.png 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" />Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</a> combine wellness-boosting CBD with energizing CBG, plus an array of adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms, including cordyceps for energy, lion&#8217;s mane for stress, and chaga for<br />
immunity. This incredibly healthy CBD mushroom tincture doesn&#8217;t mix well with a lot of drinks, because of its<br />
pronounced mushroom flavors. But in the right breakfast beverage, it can give a healthful natural energy boost to your day.</p>
<h3>CBD Oils for Chilling Out</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1692849" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx us tinctures calming mg" width="156" height="156" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</a> is a full-spectrum hemp extract that features CBN, also known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” as well as a proprietary blend of restful terpenes. Just watch your intake with this one or you may fall asleep. Like the CBD Wellness Tincture above, CBD Calming Tincture has a citrusy taste, but with notes of pine. If you like to unwind with a relaxing CBD drink at the end of a long day, this might just be the best choice for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1957011" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo render tincture unwind mushroom mar " width="158" height="158" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/">Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend</a> also features CBN, along with the stress-busting adaptogens reishi, maitake, and turkey tail, plus antioxidant-rich elderberry. Like the CBD Calming Tincture above, these CBD drops can hit you like a velvet hammer, so be mindful of your intake. Also, understand that this natural CBD mushroom tincture has strong mushroom flavors, so it won&#8217;t work for every beverage.</p>
<h3>CBD Oils for Sleep</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1839048" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx sleep tincture mg" width="170" height="170" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for a true nightcap, a bottle of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/">CBD Sleep Tincture</a> can be just the ticket to dreamland. This powerful CBD tincture contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, CBN, melatonin, and sleep terpenes. The flavor of these potent CBD drops is lemony, which pairs well with some nighttime teas.</p>

<p><i>With all of these CBD oils, please use responsibly. Don&#8217;t drive or operate heavy machinery when using any CBD oils formulated for relaxation. This is particularly true of the THC tinctures. While they contain legal levels of THC, they can cause psychotropic effects. So, tread carefully. Finally — and we cannot stress this enough — do not serve anyone CBD or THC-infused drinks without letting them know what they&#8217;re drinking. </i></p>

<h2>How to Shop for the Best Hemp Oils</h2>
<p>So, you have a great recipe for a sparkling CBD beverage. Now, it&#8217;s time to find the right CBD tincture to add to your drink. Because let&#8217;s face it, your beverage can be as sparkling as can be, and its flavors sparkling, too. But if you don&#8217;t have a pure and potent hemp tincture to add to your drink, there&#8217;s really no point in trying to make an infused CBD beverage … no matter how sparkling it is.</p>
<p>The matter, then, becomes how to find the best CBD products, in terms of both purity and potency. You can begin by only looking for products made with organic cannabis hemp. You don&#8217;t want to be serving beverages that contain pesticides and other toxins, which is exactly what you&#8217;ll be doing if you don&#8217;t choose organically grown CBD. You&#8217;ll also want to make sure your drinks are infused with CBD that has been extracted by means of clean carbon dioxide. CO2 extraction ensures that your CBD doesn&#8217;t retain any residual toxins, as can happen with some solvents that cheaper brands use for CBD extraction.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and potency of your CBD or THC tincture by looking at the Certificate of Analysis. This is a lab report generated by an independent, third-party company that not only tells you if there are any toxins in your product, but also how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in it, as well. Every reputable CBD company will provide such a report for every product they sell. At CBDfx, we provide a Certificate of Analysis for every product on our website, which can be accessed directly from the product page.</p>
