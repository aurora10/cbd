										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Directions for Best Results</h2>
<p>One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy!</p>
<p>Please note that if you’re new to delta-9 THC, you should consider trying half a pumpkin gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to fully kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the pumpkin gummy.</p>
<h2>A Fall Classic — Now in THC Gummy Form!</h2>
<p>For many, fall just wouldn’t be complete without pumpkin spice. And now, for a limited time, you can enjoy that classic autumnal flavor in a high-potency THC gummy! Our Limited-Edition THC + CBD Gummies: Pumpkin Spice Sativa deliver a whopping 10mg of delta-9 THC per one-gummy serving, along with 30mg of CBD per serving — all in a mouth-watering pumpkin spice flavor you’re sure to love. These gummies are only available for a limited time, so grab a bottle today and get cozy — things are about to get spicy!</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies</h2>
<p>Each of our <strong>delta-9 THC</strong> products (including our Pumpkin Spice <strong>THC Gummies</strong>) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious edibles are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the health and wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeostasis</a>, or balance, in several vital systems and organs. Most notably, this includes the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. The interaction between CBD and the ECS assists the various organs and systems in regulating several important functions, such as sleep, immunity, mood, memory, motor control, appetite, stress relief, pain processing, and more. This produces a wealth of health benefits and is the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Full spectrum CBD</strong> oil, which is the oil used in our <strong>Delta-9 THC Gummies</strong>, is particularly beneficial, as it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Delta-9 THC (<strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids can produce multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis connoisseurs tend to associate sativa strains with mood enhancement, feelings of exhilaration, and bursts of creativity. This uplifting feeling works wonderfully with the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> can have calming effects for the mind and for the body. Delta-9 THC also has deeply relaxing qualities, making this cannabinoid combo perfect for long, unwind-the-mind “chill” sessions.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>As noted, CBD interacts with receptors in the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several important organs and systems. THC also carries a host of health and wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, pain and stress relief, antioxidant and immunity benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the oil that’s initially extracted from the leaves, buds, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust extract includes health-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabis compounds are taken together, rather than simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is referred to as the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many people who use CBD prefer full spectrum CBD oil products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>) is the compound in cannabis that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana. That is to say, it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids, which means there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis. Delta-8 and delta-10 THC also have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC.</p>
<p>While tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high if you take enough of it, delta-9 also has several health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, sleep support, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these limited-edition gummies) only contain THC that was derived from hemp. All of the products in this collection (and on this site) are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the US legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>As noted above on this page, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects via the phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. And in a product like our Pumpkin Spice THC Gummies, which feature 30mg of CBD and 10mg of THC per serving, that means your two major cannabinoids will work in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, delivering a deeper cannabinoid experience to you.</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis plants as, simply, sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have divided cannabis into three groups: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when consumed. The properties of sativa have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Pumpkin Spice Sativa Gummies are formulated to share these effects, but are compliant with legal THC limits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product sold by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, delta-9 THC, and mushroom products (including high-potency Pumpkin Spice Delta-9 THC Gummies) is free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This oil has been extracted from the hemp by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC, and mushroom products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking lab reports</a>, which accompany every product on the CBDfx website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report, which is called a <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (COA). COAs are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. They allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. Your safety and satisfaction are our top priorities!</p>
<p><em>Warning: This product may cause psychotropic effects.</em></p>
<div class="hub-drug-tests-notice col-12 p-4 mb-3" style="border:1px solid red"><strong>Ingesting or inhaling products that contain delta-9 THC could result in the consumer failing a drug test for marijuana.</strong></div>

<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together, instead of merely working in parallel with one another, these compounds actually bolster each other’s effects.

<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid generally associated with the intoxicating, or psychoactive, effects of marijuana. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the one that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC.

<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed how multiple cannabinoids work together to actually bolster each other’s effects (the Entourage Effect). Don’t forget that THC is also a cannabinoid and, as such, delta-9 can work to boost the effects of your CBD — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, though, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three types: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This separation is generally based on leaf shape and the effects the plant generates when you consume it. The effects of cannabis sativa have generally been observed to be mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), inspiration/creativity, and anxiety reduction. Our Berry Buzz Sativa blend is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established under US law.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD, THC, and mushroom product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including this full spectrum high potency delta-9 THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by means of clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as is the case with some cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, mushroom, and delta-9 THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a>, which we provide for every product on our website. All of the best CBD brands will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. These lab reports allow you to verify that our CBD, mushroom, and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on our website and on the product label.</p>
<p>Because our CBD and THC products deliver in terms of both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx to have the best CBD products, and consider our THC gummies to be the very <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>CBD and delta-9 THC gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (yes) you eat them. This means the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into the bloodstream through your digestive system. Because of this, it takes longer to feel the effects of CBD edibles, such as CBD gummies or CBD cookies, than it does when you take a CBD or THC sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of a THC gummy.</p>
<p>On the plus side, edibles like our THC gummies stay in your bloodstream for a much longer period of time than CBD vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel the effects of a CBD edible for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your delta-9 THC or CBD product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our THC + CBD Gummies: Indica Blend</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with the endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">homeostasis</a> (balance) in several crucial systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and the brain. This interaction helps to regulate such functions as sleep, memory, mood, appetite, motor control, pain and stress management, and much more. These effects are what make CBD such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD, which is the CBD oil used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Gummies, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids of the hemp plant.

<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have gentle calming benefits for the mind and body, as does natural melatonin. Delta-9 THC, particularly in indica cannabis strains, has a deep, restful quality to it, as well!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies, have long been used to help with sleep. With additional full spectrum CBD and melatonin, these delta-9 gummies can be a wonderful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs.

This includes wellness-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In fact, there are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%).

Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC. While delta-9 can get you high if you take enough of it, this THC compound also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. All THC used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC line of products is derived from hemp, and falls within the legal threshold of less than 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We mentioned all of those cannabinoids working together to bolster each other’s effects. Don’t forget that THC is a cannabinoid and, yes, delta-9 does work to make your CBD effects more pronounced — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>While there is some disagreement within the scientific community about exactly how to classify cannabis (some want to classify <i>all</i> cannabis as sativa), users have traditionally divided cannabis into three types, based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. These three types of cannabis are cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. Generally speaking, the effects of indica are largely observed to be relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made with organically grown hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including your full spectrum high potency THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as some cheaper extraction methods do.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD and THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a> which we provide for all of our products on our website. All of the best CBD brands provide such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their veracity. By reading these lab reports, you can verify that our CBD and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on the product label, and you can make sure that our products are pure and safe.</p>
<p>Because our products deliver in both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx CBD products to be the best CBD products, and our THC gummies to be the absolute <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” with CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>THC and CBD gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (you guessed it) you eat them. As a result, the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into your bloodstream through the digestive system. It takes longer to feel the effects of edibles, like CBD gummies and CBD cookies, than it does when you take CBD or THC as a sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of your THC gummy.</p>
<p>The good news is that edibles, like our THC gummies, stay in your bloodstream for much longer than vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel their effects for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your CBD or THC product.</p>

Do you stan all things Pumpkin Spice? Try our new <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cbd-gummies-pumpkin-spice-sativa/">Limited-Edition Delta-9 THC Pumpkin Spice Gummies</a> also with 30mg of full spectrum CBD and 10mg of THC per serving.

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, however, that if you’re new to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, you should consider trying half a gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the gummy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our </span><b>delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products (including our Magic Melon </span><b>THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious </span><b>sativa gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabidiol, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for short, interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeostasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (balance) in several vital systems and organs, including the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. This interaction between CBD and the ECS helps the various systems and organs to regulate important functions such as sleep, memory, motor control, immune, mood, appetite, stress and pain management, and more. These beneficial effects are the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement. </span></p>
<p><b>Full spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil, the oil used in our </span><b>Delta-9 THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (delta-9 THC) has a bevy of wellness benefits as well, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids produce multiple benefits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis connoisseurs generally associate sativa strains with feelings of exhilaration, mood enhancement, and creativity. This uplifting feeling provides a wonderful complement to the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil can have calming effects for the mind and body. Delta-9 THC also has deep restful qualities, making this cannabinoid combination ideal for long, relaxed “chill” sessions.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, CBD interacts with receptors in the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several of its most important systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol also carries a host of wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, soothing relief for pain and stress, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the extract initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust oil extract includes wellness-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and tiny traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by US law).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, instead of simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many CBD users prefer the power of full spectrum CBD oil products!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the cannabis compound that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana (it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, which are considered minor cannabinoids (meaning there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis). Delta-8 and delta-10 THC have somewhat different effects than the major cannabinoid, delta-9 THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While delta-9 THC can definitely get you high if you take it in large enough amounts, it also has several wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) only contain THC derived from hemp. All of these products are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects (via the Entourage Effect). And in a product featuring 30mg of CBD per serving, along with 10mg of THC, that means your two major cannabinoids will be working in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, giving you a deeper cannabinoid experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are scientists who classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three categories: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when you consume it. Sativa effects have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Magic Melon Sativa is formulated to share these effects, but is still compliant with legal THC limits. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every product </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold by CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is made with organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, THC and mushroom products (including high-potency delta-9 THC gummies) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD hemp oil has been extracted by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as with some cheaper extraction methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC and mushroom products by </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which accompany every product on our website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so that you can trust their accuracy. These reports allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. You can “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</span></p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownies</h2>
<p>CBD is well known for its abundant calming and wellness-boosting benefits, particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the hemp plant. <strong>THC</strong> (tetrahydrocannabinol) also delivers a wealth of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and mood enhancement. Together, these two potent cannabinoids make a perfect choice for those looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a>’s best-known benefits is a gentle calming effect that relaxes the mind and the body. This effect is especially notable in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including cannabinol (or CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”). Delta-9 THC raises the “chill” factor even more with additional restful effects.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because of the relaxation properties of full spectrum CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, this edible is also great for easing nervous tension and stress, which can lead to anxiety for some people.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most pronounced effects of delta-9 THC is mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Brownie Bliss is formulated to deliver a gently elevated peace of mind, plus bursts of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC has several health and wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain relief, immune benefits, antioxidant effects, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially derived from the buds (flower), leaves, and stalks of the cannabis <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the chemical compounds of the plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, and flavonoids. In addition to CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cannabinoids</a>, full spectrum CBD also contains small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are minor cannabinoids with “delta” in their names, such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, delta-9 is the type of THC that is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9 THC’s full name is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, yes, this THC compound can get you high if you take it in large enough quantities. But delta-9 also has a great number of health and wellness benefits, including everything from pain and stress management to muscle relaxation to mood elevation. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownie Bliss is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, it takes a little longer to feel the effects than it would if you used a vape product or sublingual oil. When you swallow your brownie edible, CBD, THC, and the rest of the cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before being absorbed into the bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, and metabolism, as well as other factors, including the amount of CBD or THC in your product. The benefit of THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>THC Bliss + Brownie Goodness</h2>
<p>Every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. It is our goal to provide you with the very highest quality in every CBD product you buy — both in purity and potency. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 brownie, and we wish you the very best on your journey to wellness.</p>

This is especially notable when you take full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> raises the relaxation factor with additional “chill” properties.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD and delta-9 THC both deliver strong relaxation effects, this edible product works great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety for some people, if left unchecked.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most notable effects of delta-9 THC is epic mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Chocolate Chip Cookie is formulated to deliver a blissful peace of mind, plus waves of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with receptors in the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC also delivers many health and wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the most robust of all types of CBD oil. It is the unfiltered oil extract as it is initially derived from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves, and stalks. Full spectrum oil contains all of hemp’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. This includes such notable compounds as CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there is such a thing as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, these are considered “minor cannabinoids,” meaning they only occur in the tiniest quantities in cannabis. Delta-9 THC, on the other hand, is a major cannabinoid and is the psychoactive compound most associated with cannabis. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the compound that is known for getting you high if you take enough of it (as with marijuana). But delta-9 THC also has a number of health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p>It takes a bit longer to feel the effects <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, compared to a vape product or sublingual oil. This is because, when you swallow your cookie, the CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, tolerance, and metabolism, as well as the amount of CBD or THC in your edible product. The benefit of taking THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer than other products, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>Our Most Potent Cookie Ever!</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 THC Chocolate Chip Cookie delivers 20mg each of full spectrum CBD and THC. This gives you two full servings of delta-9 bliss in every one of these delectable edibles. As with every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection, this cookie is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 cookie, and we wish you the very best on your wellness journey.</p>

<h3>What Is Apple Cider Vinegar Good For?</h3>
<p>Apple cider vinegar is an incredibly popular form of vinegar, which has been used for years in a countless number of home remedies. It is created by fermenting the sugar of apples and converting it to acetic acid, which is the main active ingredient in vinegar. Acetic acid has also been found to both eliminate and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, so drinking apple cider vinegar infused products could benefit your body greatly.</p>
<p>Organic apple cider vinegar is showing promise in studies that show a positive connection between the vinegar and healthy blood sugar levels. Additionally, since apple cider vinegar can make you feel full faster, it may also improve weight loss efforts.</p>
<h3>What Is The Apple Cider Vinegar Diet?</h3>
<p>The apple cider vinegar diet is a form of dietary restraint that revolves around the consumption of the aforementioned form of vinegar. It’s fairly vague, only requiring that you have a bit of the vinegar either with each meal or as an alternative to certain foods. Since a sense of fullness often comes with consuming apple cider vinegar, weight loss is all but guaranteed, since you won’t have to eat nearly as much to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Also referred to as an “apple cider vinegar detox,” adding this type of vinegar to your diet could help you get away from some of the foods that would otherwise hinder your weight loss journey. Whether you prefer to have some of apple cider vinegar before bed, or would rather purchase a bottle of apple cider vinegar capsules to have with you on the go, there’s an option for everyone!</p>
<h3>Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies With CBD!</h3>
<p>If you thought that apple cider vinegar products were good on their own, just wait until you try them with an additional 50mg serving of premium CBD hemp extract! CBD and apple cider vinegar are a match made in heaven, and when blended together properly, they create a gummy so perfect that you’ll never have to actually learn how to drink apple cider vinegar!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Are You Vitamin Deficient?</h3>
<p>We all know we’re supposed to get a set amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients every day, but can you confidently say you’re getting what you need from your current routine?</p>
<p>If your natural diet isn’t cutting it, it may be time to infuse your days with a heaping helping of our Multivitamin Gummies. Developing a vitamin deficiency isn’t healthy, but maintaining proper nutrient levels can enhance more areas of your life than you know.</p>
<p>Thankfully, multivitamins combine a host of essential vitamins and nutrients, so you don’t have to worry about missing your recommended intake.</p>
<p>Feeling fatigued or “worn down” is one of the most common signs of vitamin deficiency, but symptoms can vary depending on which vitamins your body is lacking. This is why taking multivitamins is one of the best ways you can support better long-term health.</p>
<p>But let’s take a closer look at some of the specific signs of vitamin deficiency&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Signs That You&#8217;re Vitamin Deficient</h3>
<p>When you develop a vitamin deficiency, your body will react with specific signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>And without essential vitamins and nutrients, your body won’t grow and function naturally. As a result, you’ll feel “off” at times, fatigued, or downright sick.</p>
<p>Signs of a vitamin deficiency include…</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling Fatigued or “Worn Down”</li>
<li>Sensitive Gums That Bleed Easily</li>
<li>Brittle Hair and Nails</li>
<li>Muscle Pain or Stiffness</li>
<li>Difficulty Thinking Clearly</li>
<li>Feeling Cold All the Time</li>
<li>Mood Changes</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Vitamins Do You Need?</h3>
<p><strong>Vitamin A</strong><br />
Essential to preserving your vision—slowing age-related sight issues—Vitamin A also helps to sustain healthy immune function. It also helps you maintain your body’s natural defense to outside threats and speeds up recovery time when you’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong><br />
Although this vitamin supports many bodily functions, the body cannot produce it naturally. However, when absorbed from various fruits, vegetables, and our multivitamin gummies, Vitamin B12 can boost energy levels, improve memory, support bone health, and enhance your overall mood.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br />
Although our bodies can’t produce Vitamin C naturally, it’s extremely important for our overall health. Known to boost immunity, maintain and increase collagen production, reduce the risk of chronic disease, prevent iron deficiency, and enhance cognitive function, Vitamin C is essential to better health.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin D3</strong><br />
Known as the “sunshine” vitamin, Vitamin D is a nutrient specifically derived from the sun. Helping the body to absorb bone-strengthening calcium, Vitamin D also functions to boost immunity and enhance your overall mood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here’s What You Can Do About It&#8230;</h3>
<p>Take health and wellness into your own hands!</p>
<p>With only two gummies a day, you can ensure your body gets all of the vitamins and nutrients you need for stronger immunity, boosted energy levels, and a lasting sense of calm to take on the day.</p>
<p>It’s always the right time when it comes to taking care of your body. And thankfully, these gummies make it as simple—and tasty—as pie.</p>
