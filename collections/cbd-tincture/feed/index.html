										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBN: Sweet Dreams Blend</h2>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> that are a result of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. In terms of calming, nothing beats the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” CBN, which is a vital component of our sleep tincture. <b>THC</b> also delivers relaxation benefits, as well as wellness benefits and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful (and natural) alternative to prescription sleeping pills and other drug store sleep aids.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil has a wonderful calming effect on the mind and body. CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” takes that calming effect to the next level with deep, restful properties. Delta-9 THC and sleep terpenes also help the mind and body to unwind before bed.</p>
<h3>Deeper Sleep</h3>
<p>Every ingredient in these delta-9 sleep drops is formulated to not only help you fall asleep, but to also sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions.</p>
<h3>No “Hangover”</h3>
<p>With most sleeping pills, you can wake up in the morning feeling groggy and just plain lousy. With our THC sleep oil, there are no ill after-effects. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>When CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, it helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, which include stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the CBD oil that is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Among the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> found in full spectrum CBD are CBD (of course), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are other THC cannabinoids (such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC), delta-9 is the version of THC that is most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. The full name of delta-9 is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has several wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is derived from the hemp plant (not marijuana) and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a CBD product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms (in the great state of Kentucky!), and extracted with clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and test results are made available to all visitors on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Sleep Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN, or THC products, always look for a lab report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent lab reports for all of their products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + THC oil and rest assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC oil is taken sublingually</a> — that is, absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries under the tongue — the effects are felt much more quickly than they are when you simply swallow the oil. If you simply swallow your tincture oil, the CBD, CBN and THC have to travel through your digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. If you take your CBD oil sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in the United States — in Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in cannabis hemp farming. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown hemp is pesticide-free and contains no GMOs. You can rest assured that your CBD product is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in products from less reputable CBD brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes carbon dioxide to extract the CBD oil from the cannabis hemp plant, leaving behind no potentially harmful solvents as with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the highly purified, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and delta-9 products are quality tested by an independent, third-party lab. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers on the front page of our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>. See how full spectrum CBD oil compares to other types of CBD.<br />

<h2>Sweet Dreams Are Made of This: Delta-9 THC Drops + CBN</h2>
<p>Our Delta 9 Sweet Dreams oil drops are the finest in natural sleep supplements. Featuring organic full spectrum CBD, CBN (the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid), delta-9 THC, and sleep terpenes, this tincture is formulated to not only get you to sleep quickly, but to help you sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions. Our delta-9 sleep tincture gives you all of these sleep benefits without the morning hangover that comes with many sleeping pills. Enjoy your best sleep ever with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>The Power of Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend begins with full spectrum CBD. As we mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the hemp plant, with no cannabis materials filtered out. This means full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the term used to describe the phenomenon in which the various compounds of the hemp plant — all of the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, CBN, THC, and the rest of the compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our CBN oil for sleep), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken alone.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Sleep Oil</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). This is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. Like other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, yes, delta-9 can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with a wealth of wellness benefits — and it has many restful properties that make it the perfect ingredient for a natural CBD sleep oil.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our oil extract after the THC has been measured and increased the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>CBN: The Ultimate Relaxation Cannabinoid</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, better known as CBN, is one of the most famous and important of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of THC, meaning that it is formed when the composition of THC is altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the intoxicating properties of THC, it does carry over the relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + CBN + THC for Sleep</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 products (including our sleep tincture and chill tincture) is formulated with your health in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible and to help you on your journey to better living. Our full spectrum sleep oil can help you get a better night’s sleep, which is vital for good health. We wish you all the best on your wellness journey!</p>

<p>We mentioned that full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC). This is the legal threshold for THC content, and is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. THC also contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, while delta-9 certainly can have intoxicating properties if taken in a high enough dosage, delta-9 can also help you to achieve some of your wellness goals.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of THC products is to maximize that potential. With the legal threshold of THC content at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our extract after the THC has been measured and bumped up the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible. So, consider this THC legal THC and consider these products THC products you can use to boost your wellness potential!</p>
<h2>Go for Quality</h2>
<p>The tinctures top brands sell come with the guarantee of an independent third-party lab report. When you shop an online store for delta-9 (or really, any THC or CBD product), make sure your delta-9 product comes with such a report. This will tell you the exact mg of CBD, the exact mg of THC, and the exact mg of pretty much every cannabinoid and other compound. Additionally, the report will tell you which companies or brands are not using organic delta-9, as they will show (again, down to the mg), the amount of contaminants in your delta-9 product. Likewise, if your delta-9 product was not extracted with clean CO2 (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">as we use at CBDfx</a>), you will see the mg of chemical solvent residues, as well. For purity and potency, insist on CBD and delta-9 products that come with reports from independent, third-party labs. If a company doesn’t provide such reports, avoid their products!</p>
<h2>The Last Word on Delta-9 Chill Drops</h2>
<p>Consider our delta-9 family of products THC products you can trust. Each of these products (including our Chill Tinctures and Sleep Tinctures) is formulated with your health in mind. We consider daily health regimens vital for living your best life. And the best life requires the best supplement products.</p>
<p>You’re probably reading everything you can on product quality, what’s legal and what’s not legal, and what sort of dose you should be using for your wellness products. We get it. We understand that there are a lot of facts to be learned, as well as a sizable level of misinformation to be ignored.</p>
<p>We’re in this together, and we promise to give you only the best in CBD and THC, so that you can meet and exceed your wellness goals!</p>

<h2>Why Are CBDfx Mushroom Oils the Best Mushroom Tincture Oils?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">The CBDfx label represents quality and potency</a>. Our CBD is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art partner farms in the USA, and extracted with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">clean CO2</a>. Our mushrooms are also organically grown, ensuring that all of our CBD mushroom oil drops are the purest and most potent tincture oils on the market.</p>
<h2>How Can I Be Sure the CBD and Mushroom Extracts in My CBD Mushroom Oil Are Pure and Organic?</h2>
<p>Every reputable CBD company gets their products tested by an independent third-party laboratory, and then makes those results available to its customers. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">At CBDfx, we provide tests for every product we sell on our website</a>, so that you can be sure that there are no contaminants in your product and so that you can verify the potency of your CBD mushroom oil tincture!</p>
<h2>What Are Cordyceps Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Cordyceps sinensis</i> (cordyceps) has been linked to stress reduction on the body, increasing resistance to stress-inducing activity. This mushroom is also considered a nootropic supplement due to its positive effects on the neurological system. Cordyceps mushrooms are often taken for a boost of energy (some even take it for libido). This mushroom is great for athletes and anyone looking to ease stress-related wear and tear on the body.</p>
<h2>What Are Chaga Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Inonotus obliquus</i> (chaga) has been taken for centuries to help with immunity and overall health. This mushroom gets its nickname, chaga, from a medieval Russian prince, who took it to treat his lip (<i>gaga</i>) cancer. While we don’t make any claims about the use of chaga for such a serious disease, we can tell you it&#8217;s commonly used for immune response. Chaga is also considered to be a nootropic mushroom, due to its positive effects on brain function.</p>
<h2>What Are Lion’s Mane Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>The bushy, thorny spines of <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> are responsible for this mushroom’s ferocious nickname, lion’s mane. This mushroom has traditionally been taken for its adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and inflammation. Lion’s mane is also considered to have the greatest nootropic effects of all mushrooms.</p>

<h2>Get Up and Go! CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops</h2>
<p>Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops are the perfect way to start your day, with wellness boosting CBD, plus a powerful adaptogenic and nootropic mushroom blend for immune support, stress relief, energy and focus. These CBD mushroom drops are a great addition to any morning health regimen.</p>
<h2>The Power of Adaptogenic and Nootropic Mushrooms</h2>
<p>Mushrooms! Mushrooms! Mushrooms! The whole world seems to finally be waking up to the wellness benefits of our favorite fungi. Mushrooms have a long and interesting history that falls well beyond the tasty mushrooms we use to top our pizzas and salads. Medicinal mushroom extracts and blends have been around for millennia.</p>
<p>While we aren’t allowed (by law!) to make any medicinal claims — even as researchers continue to push forward with studies on medicinal mushroom formulas, and so forth — we can share with you the benefits that mushroom users have shared, literally, since the Chinese dynasties of the third millennium B.C.!</p>
<p>So, what are the wellness benefits that have spawned this recent mushroom revival?</p>
<h3>Understanding Adaptogens</h3>
<p>The term “adaptogen” was coined by a Russian scientist named Nikolai Lazarev shortly after World War II. In his studies, Lazarev wanted to unlock the secrets to better vitality for athletes, soldiers, and others. Adaptogenic substances refer to natural substances or supplements that reduce stress on the body.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of study on the adaptogenic properties of several mushrooms, including cordyceps, chaga, lion’s mane, reishi, maitake, and turkey tail. For our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops, we specifically use cordyceps, chaga, and lion’s mane.</p>
<h3>Understanding Nootropics</h3>
<p>Nootropics are substances and supplements that are believed to have beneficial effects on the brain and nervous tissue. This can include executive functions, creativity, memory, and energy/motivation. Lion’s mane is considered to be a great nootropic supplement, and perhaps the most powerful of all mushrooms in this area. Cordyceps and chaga are also considered to be nootropic mushrooms, delivering beneficial effects to the neurological system.</p>
<h3>How Do Adaptogenic and Noogenic Mushrooms Work in Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops?</h3>
<p>Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops contain three different mushrooms, each with its own unique and powerful properties.</p>
<h3>Cordyceps</h3>
<p>Cordyceps increases the body’s resistance to stress-inducing activity. That is, cordyceps helps the body to better deal with stress — which is the hallmark of adaptogenic mushrooms. Cordyceps is (yes, “cordyceps” is technically singular) also great for energizing the body and the mind — emblematic of the brain function support of nootropic mushrooms. The nice thing about cordyceps, as opposed to energy supplements like caffeine, is that this mushroom creates a natural energy that doesn’t give you a jittery feeling. When you take these proven mushroom extracts, you just get a powerful boost of vitality (some even take cordyceps for libido!). And with the addition of mind-calming CBD, that energy is focused. Athletes and everyday folks alike can tell you that focused energy is the best energy!</p>
<h3>Chaga</h3>
<p>Chaga has been taken for centuries (in ancient China and around the world) to help with immune response. Medieval Russian Prince Vladimir Monomakh II considered chaga to be the best of all medicinal mushrooms, reportedly taking this particular mushroom to cure his lip cancer. In fact, the name “chaga” comes from the Slavic word for “lip” (<i>gaga</i>). We won’t make any medical claims about mushroom blends with chaga or any other mushroom, for that matter (it’s not legal to do so!). But we will tell you that people have sworn by chaga as a great immune boost for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Lion’s Mane</h3>
<p>Lion’s mane is actually one of the most beautiful mushrooms you’ll ever see. These mushrooms are called lion’s mane because of their thick, bushy spines that resemble a lion’s mane. The Romans, on the other hand, thought lion’s mane looked like a fluffy hedgehog, which is what <i>erinaceus</i> means in the Latin name, <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>. However you choose to look at these mushrooms, lion’s mane has been revered for centuries for its adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and inflammation. Lion’s mane is also considered the best nootropic mushroom (supporting brain function). This is why lion’s mane mushroom extract continues to be a hot supplement for mushroom supplement companies.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Tinctures</h2>
<p>Along with unbeatable <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>, CBD also has <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-mental-benefits-of-cbd/">calming properties</a> — particularly in broad spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/">terpenes</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/">flavonoids</a> of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp plant</a>. Mushrooms can also have multiple positive effects on the body, including adaptogenic (stress relief) benefits. Our blend of CBD, mushrooms, relaxation terpenes, and antioxidant-rich elderberry gives you a boost of wellness, along with a deep, satisfying feeling of relaxation.</p>
<h3>Calming</h3>
<p>Broad spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> has a wonderful calming effect that relaxes the mind and body. This is due, in part, to the presence of CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” in the oil. This tincture also features a proprietary blend of relaxing terpenes.</p>
<h3>Stress</h3>
<p>For centuries, reishi mushrooms have been taken as an adaptogenic supplement, lending stress relief to the mind and body. These mushrooms support the adrenal glands, which in turn release cortisol to help the body respond to stress.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several crucial systems and organs. Likewise, maitake mushrooms have long been prized for their immunity and wellness benefits.</p>
<h3>Immunity</h3>
<p>Like maitake mushrooms, turkey tail has also been taken for years as a boost to the immune system. This is due, in part, to polysaccharopeptides found in the turkey tail mushroom, which have powerful immune benefits.</p>
<h2>Why Are CBDfx Mushroom Oils the Best Mushroom Oils for Sale?</h2>
<p>When you see <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you know you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted by means of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">clean CO2</a>. Our mushrooms are also organically grown in the US, ensuring that all of our CBD mushroom oil tinctures are the purest and most potent oil drops on the market.</p>
<h2>Are the CBD and Mushroom Extracts in My Mushroom Oil Pure and Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD products, you should always look for lab reports conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD company will provide such reports. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and provide a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">report for each and every product we sell</a>. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD mushroom oil drops and rest assured that they contain no contaminants!</p>
<h2>What Are Reishi Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>Nearly 5,000 years ago, reishi mushrooms were served to Chinese emperors and their royal families, and were referred to as “the mushroom of immortality.” <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> (reishi) is considered an adaptogen and is believed to help support the adrenal glands. This, in turn, releases cortisol to help the body respond to stress. Reishi mushrooms are also a rich source for vitamins (especially vitamin D), minerals, dietary fiber, and amino acids.</p>
<h2>What Are Maitake Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>Maitake means “dancing mushroom” in Japanese. <i>Grifola frondosa</i> got this name because people in feudal Japan would dance for joy when they found these valuable mushrooms. The reason maitake mushrooms were considered to be so valuable is because of their beneficial immunity and wellness properties. Among the nutrients in this delicious mushroom are vitamins B and C, potassium, copper and other minerals, amino acids, beta-glucans, fiber, and healthful antioxidants.</p>
<h2>What Are Turkey Tail Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Trametes versicolor</i> is better known as turkey tail, not because it’s necessarily a Thanksgiving tradition, but more for its colorful, fan-like structure. Turkey tail mushrooms are well known for their beneficial immune properties. Turkey tail contains two different polysaccharopeptides, which have powerful benefits for the immune system. Turkey tail mushrooms are also stuffed with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, plus vitamins B3 and D.</p>

<p>Legally, we can’t (and won’t) make any medicinal claims about mushrooms (or CBD, for that matter. But there have been a number of research studies on medicinal mushroom formulas, and what we can do is share with you the benefits that mushroom users have shared for nearly 5,000 years.</p>
<p>So, what are the wellness benefits of those fabulous mushrooms and their wonderful extracts?</p>
<h3>What Are Adaptogens?</h3>
<p>A Russian scientist named Nikolai Lazarev coined the term “adaptogen” during the late 1940s. Lazarev wanted to unlock the secrets to better vitality for Russian athletes, soldiers, and others. His research centered around adaptogens, which are natural substances or supplements that reduce stress on the body.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of study, over the years, on the adaptogenic properties of several mushrooms, including cordyceps, lion’s mane, reishi, chaga, maitake, and turkey tail. For our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops, we specifically use reishi, maitake, and turkey tail.</p>
<h3>How Do Adaptogenic Mushrooms Work in Our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops?</h3>
<p>Our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops contain three different mushrooms, each with its own unique and powerful properties.</p>
<h3>Reishi</h3>
<p><i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>, better known as the reishi mushroom, has been revered for its nutrients and wellness properties as far back as the third millennium B.C. These mushrooms were considered so precious that they were served to the emperors and royal families of ancient China. Reishi was referred to as “the mushroom of immortality.” Reishi mushrooms are considered to be adaptogens and are believed to help support the adrenal glands, releasing cortisol to help in the body’s response to stress. They’re also a wonderful source for vitamins (vitamin D, in particular), minerals, dietary fiber, and amino acids. In a relaxation supplement, like our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops, reishi provides a perfect response to stress, with the added benefit of several key nutrients.</p>
<h3>Maitake</h3>
<p>The people of feudal Japan would dance for joy if they happened to find <i>Grifola frondosa</i> in the wild. That’s why they named this valuable mushroom the “dancing mushroom,” or maitake. Maitake mushrooms were considered to be so valuable because they were packed with nutrients and immune benefits. Among many nutrients in maitake mushrooms are vitamins B and C, potassium, copper and other minerals, amino acids, beta-glucans, fiber, and healthful antioxidants. We include maitake in our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops because they add a boost of wellness and immune benefits, helping to lift this tincture beyond a mere relaxation product to a true wellness supplement.</p>
<h3>Turkey Tail</h3>
<p>Turkey tail mushrooms (sometimes spelled as turkeytail) get their name because, well, they look just like the vibrant, fanlike tail of a turkey. They’re actually quite beautiful to see in the wild. Formally known as <i>Trametes versicolor</i>, these mushrooms are known for their beneficial immune properties. Turkey tail contains two different polysaccharopeptides, which are considered immunopotentiators. Immunopotentiators are compounds that activate immune cells through various receptors or pathways in the body. In short, turkey tail mushrooms have powerful benefits for the immune system. These mushrooms also have plenty of vitamin B3, vitamin D, antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, and are a healthful addition to this complex CBD, elderberry and mushroom blend.</p>

This CBD sleep tincture is available in a 30mL bottle, regular strength (1000mg CBD &#38; 150mg CBN); in a larger 60mL bottle, extra strength (2000mg CBD &#38; 300mg CBN); and then in a larger 120mL bottle, maximum strength (4000mg CBD &#38; 600mg CBN).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>CBD Oil Sleep Tincture</strong></h2>
<p>Nothing beats a good night’s sleep. It allows your body to repair itself and release harmful toxins, as well as other wellness-enhancing benefits. But sometimes, we need help to get the full eight hours we all so desperately need. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-sleep/">CBD Sleep Tinctures</a> offer a generous serving of calming broad spectrum CBD — up to 33mg per serving — paired with CBN, commonly known as the “relaxation cannabinoid,” and Melatonin. Together, they create a powerful CBD Sleep Tincture to help even the most restless sleeper get a better night’s rest. And, unlike many tinctures on the market today, our CBD Sleep Tinctures have a delightful flavor.</p>
<p>Added to this CBD oil for sleep is a blend of terpenes, specially formulated to enhance restful sleep. Our CBD Oil Sleep Tincture also includes MCT oil, which enhances the bioavailability of the CBD in your bloodstream, in addition to its own wellness-enhancing properties. But that’s not all. We’ve even added 5mg of melatonin to every serving, so that you’ll not only find it easier to drift off, but also you’ll be able to stay asleep without waking up off and on during the night. And the best part is, with our all-natural, non-addictive CBD sleep tinctures, you won’t have to deal with the groggy after-effects people often encounter with prescription sleeping pills.</p>
<p>And because not everyone has the same needs or tolerances, we’re offering these CBD drops for sleep in three different formulations: in a 30mL bottle, you’ll find regular strength (1000mg CBD &amp; 150mg CBN); in a larger 60mL bottle, we offer a extra strength (2000mg CBD &amp; 300mg CBN); and then in a larger 120mL bottle, we offer a maximum strength (4000mg CBD &amp; 600mg CBN).</p>
<h3><strong>CBN Tinctures for Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>CBN, or cannabinol, is a minor cannabinoid and a derivative of THC. When THC ages, it becomes CBN. But unlike its parent compound, CBN is a non-psychoactive, so it does not get you “high.” Furthermore, CBN has many wellness benefits, the most notable being the calming effect it has on the body and mind. This calming effect makes it easier to unwind your mind to prepare you for sleep and is one of the main reasons why CBN tinctures for sleep are such a popular choice for those suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>Similar to the way other cannabinoids work in the body’s endocannabinoid system, CBN binds to CB1 receptors. The result is a deep restfulness of the body and mind. This physiological effect tells the body it’s time for sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Include CBD + CBN Oil in the Sleep Tincture?</strong></h3>
<p>On its own, CBD is a powerful and effective compound that impacts positively on the body’s endocannabinoid system, which regulates and balances sleep, immune response, communication between cells, appetite and metabolism, memory, and other vital processes. When CBD is combined with other cannabinoids, such as CBN, it produces what is known as the Entourage Effect. In essence, each cannabinoid increases the effectiveness of the other. When terpenes are added to the mix, that effectiveness grows even stronger.</p>
<h3><strong>CBD Drops for Sleep Rate for Quality &amp; Purity</strong></h3>
<p>At CBDfx, all of our hemp is grown right here in the U.S.A., in the richly soiled hills of Kentucky. We choose only the best hemp plants for our CBD oil production: 100% organic and lab-tested by a third-party for exceptional quality and transparency. All of our CBD Oil Tinctures are made to exacting standards, containing only natural, plant-based ingredients to give you the most effective experience possible.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> This product will cause extreme drowsiness and/or sleepiness. Do not take when driving, operating heavy machinery, or engaging in any activity that requires alertness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">CBD + CBN Oil Calming Tincture</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A New Take on Our Classic CBD Tincture Oils:</p>
<p>Welcome to the state of calm with our CBN + CBD Oil Tincture.</p>
<p>Taking what you loved about our classic <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/">CBD Tinctures</a>, we’ve updated them to enhance their flavor (now delightfully herbaceous <span style="font-weight: 400;">with no “hempy” after taste</span>) while adding CBN! From Classic to Calming, our latest tincture iteration marks a new step forward for an old favorite!</p>
<p>With more than 27% of Americans suffering from some form of sleep disorder, it’s no surprise that getting a good night’s sleep has become harder than ever. Not only does a lack of sleep leave us tired and groggy the following day, but it’s also incredibly detrimental to our health.</p>
<p>To cater to your needs, tolerance, and preference, our CBD + CBN Calming Tinctures are available in a variety of strengths from extra strength (1000mg), maximum strength (2000mg), maximum strength plus (4000mg), and ultra strength (6000mg).</p>
<h2>What is CBN?</h2>
<p>Unfamiliar to many hemp users, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a> is a naturally occuring minor cannabinoid and a derivative of THC.</p>
<h3>The Role of Sleep on Health:</h3>
<p>Everybody needs to sleep. Unfortunately, sleep doesn’t always come easy when we ask for it. Whether it’s stress, anxiety, or depression, there are a variety of factors that can make sleep more difficult than we’re used to. To add insult to injury, sleep can also have serious effects on our health, affecting even our immune system.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Try Our CBN + CBD Tincture Oil?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the fact that it’s made from natural ingredients, our CBD + CBN Calming Tinctures work to help you sleep without leaving you feeling groggy the next morning. That means no strange physiological responses or dreams, just pure and natural sleep. Our CBD products are non-addictive and non-habit forming, so you can use them without worry and be able to rest easily. </span></p>
<h3>Made In The U.S.A</h3>
<p>Thanks to the healthy soil and farming practices found right here in the U.S.A., we’re proud to say that our hemp is home-grown in the hills of Kentucky. Choosing only the best hemp plants for CBD production, our hemp is 100% organic and selected for its exceptional quality every time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Containing a health-boosting 2:1 ratio of broad spectrum CBD to CBG— two of the most important cannabinoids— this next-generation CBD + CBG oil tincture also delivers the therapeutic effects of two antioxidant powerhouses, Coenzyme Q10 and Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric. Available in extra strength (1000mg), maximum strength (2000mg), maximum strength plus (4000mg), and ultra strength (6000mg).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">CBD + CBG Oil Wellness Tincture 1000-6000mg</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to a total revolution in plant-based wellness.</strong></p>
<p>Our Wellness <strong><em>2:1 ratio</em></strong> <strong>CBD + CBG</strong> Oil Tincture comes in four different concentrations: extra-strength 1000mg, a maximum strength 2000mg, a maximum strength plus 4000mg, and ultra strength 6000mg — so you can tailor the experience to fit your needs. The <strong><em>2:1 ratio</em></strong> means that for every two parts CBD, you’ll get one part CBG. For example, with the 2000mg Wellness 2:1 Tincture, you get 2000mg of CBD and 1000mg of CBG.</p>
<p>This 2:1 ratio of broad spectrum CBD to CBG Tincture, blended with 18 proprietary terpenes, Curcumin, and Coenzyme Q10, represents a massive leap forward in the formulation of CBD tinctures. This super blend contains exceptional cannabinoids like CBG, CBC, and CBD-V that boost the “entourage effect” to provide you with the wellness results you’re looking for! Remember, CBD works best when it’s paired with the other cannabinoids found within the hemp plant&#8230; and this tincture is chock full of them.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS CBG Oil?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering what makes this other compound “CBG” so important? CBG is a minor cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant that has biologically active properties which make it incredibly exciting for hemp and CBD lovers. CBG stands for cannabigerol, which interacts directly with the CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain to provide further balance within the body by interacting with your endocannabinoid system.</p>
<h3>WHY SHOULD YOU BUY CBD + CBG OIL TINCTURE?</h3>
<p>So, what makes this Wellness 2:1 Tincture a “super blend” that helps impart so many essential nutrients and vitamins? Besides CBD and CBG, curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric; and it’s a natural, yet powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that people have been taking advantage of for centuries. Coenzyme Q10, also known as CoQ10, has a wide range of health benefits as well. CoQ10 is a nutrient that is naturally produced within our bodies and plays a vital role in energy production and much more, but as we get older the natural production of this nutrient slows. By supplementing with CoQ10, you’re helping your body function at its highest level, day in and day out.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS CURCUMIN?</h3>
<p>Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric. It’s a potent antioxidant and even more powerful anti-inflammatory that can lower your risk for certain diseases, illnesses, and health conditions. This active ingredient also has the capability to support healthy weight loss, mood balance, brain function, and it even has detoxifying qualities. It’s a well-rounded compound that can really do it all!</p>
<h3>WHAT IS COENZYMEQ10?</h3>
<p>This is an antioxidant that the body naturally produces and our cells use it for energy production. The rate in which we naturally produce CoenzymeQ10 decreases with age, so as we age, it’s helpful to supplement it. As an antioxidant, it also works to protect your body from free radicals as well.</p>
<p>Our level of attention to quality ingredients and best-in-class extraction methods helps you Feel the Difference the first time, and every time.</p>
