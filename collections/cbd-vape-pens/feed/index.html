										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBN: Purple Punch Indica</h2>
<p>Due to its <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interaction with the endocannabinoid system</a><b>, CBD</b> has a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> for the mind and body. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the hemp plant’s <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only brings wellness benefits through its own interaction with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can be a wonderful natural relaxant — particularly with indica strains, such as Purple Punch. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a> (cannabinol) also has deep calming effects for users, which is why it’s often referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have a gentle calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, particularly in indica strains, has restful quality to it, as well — as does the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid, CBN!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, like Purple Punch, have long been used to help with sleep. Combining Purple Punch delta-9 THC with full spectrum CBD and added CBN makes for a blissful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, sleep support, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the CBD oil that is extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD oil contains all of hemp’s healthful chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD (naturally), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 THC is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Tetrahydrocannabinol</a> is one of two major cannabinoids, the other one being CBD. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. If you take delta-9 in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC threshold established by law in the US.</p>
<h2>What Is CBN?</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, or CBN, is one of the most notable of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning it is formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the psychoactive properties of THC, it does carry over the deep relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) to such an extent that CBN is referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>There is some disagreement in the scientific community about how to distinguish the different types of cannabis. Some scientists classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others consider them as three distinct species. Whatever the case, cannabis users have traditionally separated cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer (for example, sativa strains add an uplifting feeling for the user). In general, the effects of indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits. Our Purple Punch cannabis CBN vape is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by US law.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">CBDfx product</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting highly rated, quality CBD. Every ml of our CBD oil is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with pure carbon dioxide. All of our CBD products — including Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If the Oil in My CBN + THC Vape Pen Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN or THC delta products, always look for a detailed report conducted by a third-party lab. Every reputable CBD or THC delta brand will provide independent laboratory reports for all of their CBD and delta cannabis products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency for our customers and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta cannabis product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + Delta-9 THC oil and be assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the CBD or THC Effects of a Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping THC or CBD</a> is the fastest way to experience the effects of the cannabinoids. This is due to the fact that the CBD and THC are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to eat, say, a CBD cookie or use a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you use a CBD or THC vape product, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes (or sooner), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the cannabis we use for our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> hemp products is grown in the United States, in the state of Kentucky. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown cannabis hemp contains no GMOs, and you can be assured that your CBD product is also free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals often found in CBD products from less reputable brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes carbon dioxide to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant. This method leaves behind no potentially harmful solvents, which can happen with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic CBD oil has been extracted from our cannabis hemp, we combine it with other natural ingredients — which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and THC delta products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. Lab reports for every product are made available on the front page of our website and via a QR code on the product label.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, which is derived from organically grown hemp and is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>. See how full spectrum CBD compares to other types of CBD oil.</p>

<h2>Vaping Delta-9 Via the Purple Punch Indica Strain</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Purple Punch Disposable Vape Pens have deep and powerful relaxation benefits. Capturing the heavy calm of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, these THC vape pens give you the earthy flavor and chill of this classic indica, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. With a CBD THC pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles. In addition to all of this, you can also benefit from the wellness properties of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Using Full Spectrum CBD Oil in Vape Products</h2>
<p>The robust ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD oil” refers to CBD as it is directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of delta 9 THC or other materials filtered out. And so, full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, a powerful profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD delivers an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> for the user. Entourage Effect is the term for the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — the cannabinoids, the terpenes and the flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, CBN, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a product containing full spectrum CBD oil (such as our THC delta pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if you had taken it on its own.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens and the Role of THC</h3>
<p>As discussed, full spectrum CBD contains non-psychoactive trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like cannabidiol itself, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including muscle relaxation, sleep support, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids (like CBN), THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 can have psychoactive properties if you take a large enough dosage, but delta-9 THC can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC product line is to maximize the wellness potential of delta-9 THC. With the legal threshold of tetrahydrocannabinol content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve revisited our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we’ve increased the amount of delta-9 so that it’s much closer to the legal THC limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — such as our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant in the US, but it also allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vapes</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our THC vape pens) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. Our goal is to give our customers the best CBD experience possible. Our delta-9 THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while also enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with full spectrum CBD and the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We wish the very best for you on your wellness journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBD: Maui Wowie Sativa</h2>
<p><b>CBD</b> has a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>, due to its <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interaction with the body’s endocannabinoid system</a>. This is particularly true of full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can elevate mood — particularly with sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie. CBD and THC also have natural calming properties that make a product, like our CBD + Delta-9 Sativa Pen, great for chilling out and enjoying the day!</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis sativa strains are largely associated with feelings of exhilaration and positive mood enhancement. These peaceful, uplifting effects are the perfect complement to CBD’s gentle calming properties.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil can have a peaceful calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has a restful quality to it, making this combination perfect for a relaxed “chill” session.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>

</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized extraction process that utilizes carbon dioxide to remove the CBD oil from the hemp plant. This leaves behind no potentially harmful solvents, as can happen with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the pure, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our cannabis hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and delta-9 THC products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. The results of these lab tests are made available on the front page of our website and via a QR code on every product label.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Maui Wowie Sativa is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown cannabis hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>.

<h2>The Magic Strain: Vaping Maui Wowie Sativa</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Maui Wowie Disposable Vape Pens are perfect for kicking back and chilling out. Capturing the feel-good vibes of the legendary cannabis strain Maui Wowie, these THC vape pens give you the flavor and mood elevation of this classic sativa, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the finest of all cannabis flavor profiles. In addition to all of this, you can also experience the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Vaping With Full Spectrum CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Maui Wowie Sativa begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of hemp THC or other materials filtered out. As a result, full spectrum CBD oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD delivers users an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a>. This is the term used to describe the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the rest of the cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our delta-9 pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken on its own.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like CBD itself, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 THC can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the legal threshold of THC content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we have increased the amount of delta-9 THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — including our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant, but it allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vape Products</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our delta-9 vape pens) is formulated with your wellness and enjoyment in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible. Our full spectrum THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with CBD and the healthful compounds of the hemp plant. We wish you the very best on your wellness journey!</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Hybrid Vape Pen </span></h2>
<p><b>CBD</b> <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interacts with the endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deliver a host of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the mind and body. This is especially true when it comes to full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant, including the </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it also has other effects. Cannabis sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie, can elevate mood and spark creativity. Cannabis indica strains, such as Purple Punch, provide deep calming benefits to the mind and body. Hybrid strains, including the Pineapple Express strain featured in this vape pen, are the best of both worlds — ideal for elevating your mood and chilling you out!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis sativa strains are often associated with positive mood enhancement and feelings of exhilaration. A hybrid strain, such as Pineapple Express, gives you this and more!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis indica strains are valued for their relaxation properties — and cannabis hybrids can deliver this, as well. Plus, you get all the calming effects of full spectrum CBD, too!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in many crucial systems and organs. Delta-9 THC also delivers several wellness benefits, including antioxidant and immune benefits, stress and pain relief, sleep support, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil is the oil that’s extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids found in the cannabis hemp plant. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 such cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-psychoactive, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 (or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. Delta-9 THC is one of two major cannabinoids in cannabis, the other being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 shouldn’t be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which have somewhat different properties than delta-9 and are considered minor cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take delta-9 THC in large enough quantities, it can get you high. But delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Disposable Vape Pen: Pineapple Express Hybrid is derived from cannabis hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to all legal thresholds for THC and CBD products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many scientists classify all cannabis as sativa, including indica and ruderalis. Traditionally, cannabis users have separated cannabis types on the basis of their leaf shape and the effects the plant delivers when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation, creativity, and anxiety reduction. Indica is most known for its deep relaxation properties. Hybrid strains are formed when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also cannabis ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part it’s sativa and indica we’re talking about). Hybrids can deliver the best of both types of cannabis, which is why a cannabis hybrid, like Pineapple Express, is so popular with cannabis enthusiasts. Please keep in mind that all of our products are derived from hemp (not marijuana) and have legal levels of THC (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy a CBD or THC product with </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CBDfx label</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can be assured that you’re getting a highly rated, quality product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our CBD oil is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp oil is extracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by means of clean, efficient CO2. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our CBD and THC products — including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + THC Delta-9 Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory, and those </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are made available to all of our customers. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD + Delta-9 product and be assured that it is free of harmful contaminants. And with discreet shipping, you can enjoy our delta-9 THC vape products with all the privacy you require.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a CBD or THC Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaping CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the quickest way to experience its effects. The same applies to delta-9 THC vape products. With vapes, CBD, THC and other cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs, which happens much faster than if you were to enjoy CBD edibles, like cookies or gummies, or even a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you vape CBD or THC, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vape Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Delta-9 Pineapple Express Disposable Vape Pens are great for good vibes and chilling out. Combining the mood-lifting spirit of a sativa with the relaxation of an indica, these hybrid THC vape pens give you the perfect THC vape experience, but within the legal boundaries of the 2018 Farm Bill. With a disposable pen vape, you can feel these delta 9 effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition to all of this, you also get the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our delta-9 THC products is formulated with your wellness and enjoyment in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible. Our full spectrum THC vape pens can give you the wellness and relaxation benefits of delta-9 THC, and add the wellness benefits associated with CBD, plus all the other healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant.

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum oil is the CBD oil that’s extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids found in the hemp plant. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 such cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and non-psychoactive, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 (a.k.a. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>) is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. Delta-9 THC is one of two major cannabinoids, the other being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 THC shouldn’t be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which have somewhat different properties than delta-9 and are considered minor cannabinoids. If you take delta-9 in large enough quantities, this form of THC can get you high. But THC delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The THC delta-9 we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Disposable Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to all legal thresholds for THC and CBD products.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</h2>
<p>Many scientists classify all cannabis types as sativa, including indica and ruderalis. Traditionally, cannabis users have classified cannabis types on the basis of their leaf shape and the effects the plant delivers when consumed. In general, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), creativity, and anxiety reduction. Indica is most noted for its deep relaxation properties. Hybrid strains are formed when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part it’s sativa and indica we’re talking about). Hybrid cannabis strains can deliver the best of both types of cannabis, which is why a cannabis hybrid, like Wedding Cake, is so popular with cannabis enthusiasts. Please remember that all of our products are derived from cannabis hemp (so, this is not hybrid marijuana) and have legal levels of THC (less than 0.3%).</p>
<h2>Know Your Brand: What Is the Best Delta-9 THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you buy a CBD or delta-9 product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can be assured that you’re getting a highly rated, quality CBD product. Our CBD oil is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with clean carbon dioxide. All of our CBD and THC products — including CBD + THC Delta-9 Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. And with discreet shipping, you can enjoy our THC vapes delta products with all the privacy you require.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If the Delta-9 CBD Oil in My Disposable Vape Pen Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD or THC delta-9 products, such as a disposable pen or disposable cartridge, always remember to look for an accompanying report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable and well rated CBD brand should provide independent lab test results for all of their THC flower delta 9 products. We believe in transparency and always provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab results report</a> for every CBD and THC product we sell. This means that you can really verify the potency of your CBD + Delta-9 product and be assured that it is free of harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a Delta-9 CBD Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping CBD</a> is the quickest way to experience its effects. This applies to delta-9 THC, as well. CBD, THC and other cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs, which happens much faster than if you were to enjoy CBD edibles, like cookies or gummies, or even sample a sublingual CBD tincture. When you vape CBD, THC and other cannabinoids, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance. That said, we do enjoy a good CBD cookie, too!</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the hemp we use for our highly rated <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> and delta-9 products is American-grown in the state of Kentucky. All of our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>

<h2>Let Them Have Cake: Vaping Wedding Cake Delta 9 Hybrid</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Wedding Cake Disposable Vape Pens are perfect for good vibes and relaxation. Combining the uplifting spirit of a sativa with the chill of an indica, these hybrid THC vape pens give you the perfect CBD vape delta 9 experience, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a disposable pen vape, you can feel these delta 9 effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition to all of this, you also get the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Vaping With Full Spectrum CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned above, “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil directly extracted from the cannabis hemp plant, with all of the chemical content of the hemp plant, including trace amounts of THC. That full spectrum content includes all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD provides an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a>. This is the phenomenon wherein all of the compounds of the hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a full spectrum CBD product (such as our delta-9 pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken on its own.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens</h3>
<p>As we’ve noted before, full spectrum CBD contains non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). As with CBD, those trace amounts of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) actually have many wellness benefits, including mood elevation, sleep support, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, and more. As with other cannabinoids (such as CBG and CBN), THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 THC can have psychoactive effects if you take a large enough dosage, but THC delta-9 can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our THC line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the legal threshold of THC content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we go into our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we add the more delta-9 THC so that the resulting oil is much closer to the legal limit. The bolstered delta-9 THC product — such as our highly rated CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant, but it allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vape Products</h2>
<p>Each of our THC oil products (including our delta-9 vape pens) is formulated with your wellness and enjoyment in mind. Our goal at CBDfx is to give you the best CBD experience possible. Our full spectrum THC vape pens can give you the wellness and relaxation benefits of delta-9, and add the wellness benefits associated with CBD and the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We wish you the very best on your wellness journey!</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of the OG Kush Indica THC + CBD Vape Pen </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its positive effects on the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><b>, CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers a host of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the mind and body. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the hemp plant’s </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only brings wellness benefits through its own interaction with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can have wonderful relaxation effects — particularly with cannabis indica strains, such as OG Kush.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can have a gentle calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, particularly in indica strains, has a deep restful quality to it, as well. Together, they offer both the body and mind blissful relaxation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced Sleep</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indica cannabis strains, like OG Kush, have long been used to help with sleep. Combining OG Kush delta-9 THC with full spectrum CBD makes for a potent sleep product.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, sleep support, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the CBD oil that is extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD oil contains all of hemp’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD oil, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (naturally), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, in accordance with US law). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC is the cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoid compounds found in cannabis plants, the other one being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. If you take delta-9 THC in large enough quantities, this powerful cannabinoid can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: OG Kush Indica is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC threshold (less than 0.3%) established by US law.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Indica?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some disagreement within the scientific community about how to distinguish the different types of cannabis. Some scientists classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as cannabis sativa, while others consider them to be three distinct species. Whatever the case, cannabis users have traditionally distinguished different types of cannabis based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer (for example, sativa strains add an uplifting feeling for the user). In general, the effects of indica — as used in this vape pen — can be observed as deep relaxation for the mind and body, plus sleep benefits. Our OG Kush vape pen is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by US law. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can rest assured that you’re getting highly rated, quality CBD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaping THC or CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the fastest way to experience the effects of these powerful cannabinoids. This is because the CBD and THC are absorbed into your bloodstream through the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to eat, say, a CBD cookie or use a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you use a CBD or delta-9 THC vape product, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes (or sooner), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Full Spectrum CBD Oil in Vape Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The robust ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: OG Kush Indica begins with full spectrum CBD oil. The term “full spectrum CBD oil” refers to CBD as it is directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of delta-9 THC or any other materials filtered out. And so, full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBN, CBC, CBG, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, healthful terpenes and flavonoids.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD delivers an experience known as the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the user. Entourage Effect is the term used to describe the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — the cannabinoids, the terpenes and the flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a product containing full spectrum CBD oil (such as our OG Kush THC delta pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if you had taken it on its own.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum Delta-9 Vape Pens and the Role of THC</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed, full spectrum CBD oil contains non-psychoactive trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like CBD, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including muscle relaxation, sleep support, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC product line is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at less than 0.3% in dry weight hemp, we’ve revisited our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we’ve increased the amount of delta-9 THC in it, so that it’s much closer to the legal THC limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — such as our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant in the US, but it also allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, that even though the THC in our vape pens is derived from hemp and within legal limits, delta-9 THC can cause psychoactive effects if you take enough of it. So, please don’t drive or operate heavy machinery if you use our THC vape products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vapes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Delta-9 OG Kush Disposable Vape Pens offer powerful relaxation benefits. Capturing the heavy calm of the legendary cannabis strain OG Kush, these delta-9 THC vape pens give you the earthy flavor and chill of this classic indica, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. With a CBD + THC pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our OG Kush THC vape pens) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. Our goal is to give our customers the best CBD experience possible. Our OG Kush delta-9 THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while also enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with full spectrum CBD and the other healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We hope you enjoy your vape pen and wish the very best for you on your wellness journey!</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why the Best CBD Vape Pens Use Broad Spectrum CBD Oil</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three different </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">types of CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: full spectrum CBD oil, broad spectrum CBD oil, and CBD isolate. Full spectrum CBD oil is the oil that is collected from the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-difference-between-marijuana-cbd-and-hemp-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> during the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD extraction process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. This CBD oil contains all of the chemical compounds present in the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stalks. This includes all of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> present in the hemp plant, including CBD, CBN, CBC, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-101-cbg-vs-cbd-whats-the-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, THC, and more. It should be noted that, by law, hemp plants must have </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-much-thc-is-in-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400">less than 0.3% THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, making it </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cbd-does-cbd-get-you-high/"><span style="font-weight: 400">non-intoxicating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains the various terpenes and flavonoids present in the hemp plant, as well.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/which-type-of-cbd-extract-is-best-for-me/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Broad spectrum CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is created when an extra round of filtering is done on the full spectrum CBD oil, removing all detectable amounts of THC. In the process, this filtering also removes some of the other cannabinoid and terpene content, though it still leaves a robust cannabinoid profile behind in the oil. Broad spectrum CBD oil is often preferred by people who want a complex CBD experience, but don’t want to risk a false-negative on a drug test. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd-isolate-the-definitive-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD isolate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is 99% pure CBD, meaning all other cannabinoids and other hemp-derived compounds have been removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because broad spectrum CBD maximizes the benefits and minimizes the liabilities involved in using CBD oil, we decided that it would be the best choice for our CBD vape pens — including our CBD Blue Raspberry Vape Pen! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Are the Benefits of Using a CBD Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD vape pens, such as our CBD Blue Raspberry Vape Pen, are small, discreet, and extremely portable. Due to their small size, you can take them anywhere without hassle. The best part is that our CBD vape pens come fully charged, so that you never have to worry about buying chargers. In fact, the vape pens are disposable as well, so once you’re done consuming the CBD-infused vapor, you can simply toss it away for a no-fuss experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why CBDfx Makes the Best CBD Vape Pens</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At CBDfx, we have </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-people-choose-cbdfx-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400">the best lab-tested CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> available anywhere. Whether you want to see CBD lab results to make sure your CBD products are free of contaminants, or you want to confirm that your favorite CBD product really contains the amount of CBD we say it does, you can always look on our site for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400">third-party lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for every CBD product we sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Providing lab testing helps us promote transparency, and you’ll also note that our ingredient list is very simple. Some CBD companies think they can get away with adding fillers and thickeners to their CBD vape products to pad their margins, but here at CBDfx, it’s easy to see that we’re offering the genuine article. When you only have four ingredients in your vape oil products, there isn’t much you can hide.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Ingredients Are in My Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our CBD vape pens only contain four ingredients: </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-does-cbd-stand-for-a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">organic CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, propylene glycol, vegetable glycol, and flavoring. That’s it. No fillers and none of the harmful additives, such as vitamin E acetate, that some less reputable brands may use.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Broad Spectrum CBD</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Pen contains broad spectrum CBD, organically grown in the great state of Kentucky. We use only the cleanest extraction method — CO2 extraction — to remove the CBD oil from the hemp plant. Because of our firm commitment to quality at every stage of cultivation and production, you can be assured that you’re getting the best CBD oil available. And we have the third-party lab reports to prove it!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Propylene Glycol </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A vaping standard, propylene glycol is a colorless, odorless liquid used in a variety of food and medical applications. It helps to evenly distribute the taste and flavor of the vape juice.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Vegetable Glycol </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also an essential component of vaping products, vegetable glycol is a natural chemical derived from vegetable oil. It’s used to give a certain level of thickness to the vapor, and smoothes out the harshness of the propylene glycol, giving your e-liquid flavors more body.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Expertly Crafted Flavors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flavorings we use in our CBD vape products are often used in food-based applications, such as gelatins. These natural and artificial ingredients are safe to consume and, when combined well, can make some great flavors!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Last Word on CBD Blue Raspberry Vape Pens</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our CBD Blue Raspberry Vape Pens give you the sweet, fruity taste of blue raspberries along with the “chill” of organic, broad spectrum CBD. And with our top-quality pens, you’ll get a reliable hit every time. Discreet and durable, they’re the perfect CBD product to take anywhere you go!</span></p>

This includes all of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> present in the hemp plant, including CBD, CBN, CBC, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-101-cbg-vs-cbd-whats-the-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, THC, and more.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because broad spectrum CBD maximizes the benefits and minimizes the liabilities involved in using CBD oil, we decided that it would be the best choice for our CBD vape pens — including our CBD Fresh Mint Vape Pen! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Are the Benefits of Using a CBD Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD vape pens, such as our CBD Fresh Mint Vape Pen, are small, discreet, and extremely portable. Due to their small size, you can take them anywhere without hassle. The best part is that our CBD vape pens come fully charged, so that you never have to worry about buying chargers. In fact, the vape pens are disposable as well, so once you’re done consuming the CBD-infused vapor, you can simply toss it away for a no-fuss experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why CBDfx Makes the Best CBD Vape Pens</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At CBDfx, we have </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-people-choose-cbdfx-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400">the best lab-tested CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> available anywhere. Whether you want to see CBD lab results to make sure your CBD products are free of contaminants, or you want to confirm that your favorite CBD product really contains the amount of CBD we say it does, you can always look on our site for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400">third-party lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for every CBD product we sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Providing lab testing helps us promote transparency, and you’ll also note that our ingredient list is very simple. Some CBD companies think they can get away with adding fillers and thickeners to their CBD vape products to pad their margins, but here at CBDfx, it’s easy to see that we’re offering the genuine article. When you only have four ingredients in your vape oil products, there isn’t much you can hide.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Ingredients Are in My Fresh Mint CBD Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our CBD vape pens only contain four ingredients: </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-does-cbd-stand-for-a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">organic CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, propylene glycol, vegetable glycol, and flavoring. That’s it. No fillers and none of the harmful additives, such as vitamin E acetate, that some less reputable brands may use.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Broad Spectrum CBD</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our Fresh Mint CBD Vape Pen contains broad spectrum CBD, organically grown in the great state of Kentucky. We use only the cleanest extraction method — CO2 extraction — to remove the CBD oil from the hemp plant. Because of our firm commitment to quality at every stage of cultivation and production, you can be assured that you’re getting the best CBD oil available. And we have the third-party lab reports to prove it!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Propylene Glycol </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A vaping standard, propylene glycol is a colorless, odorless liquid used in a variety of food and medical applications. It helps to evenly distribute the taste and flavor of the vape juice.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Vegetable Glycol </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also an essential component of vaping products, vegetable glycol is a natural chemical derived from vegetable oil. It’s used to give a certain level of thickness to the vapor, and smoothes out the harshness of the propylene glycol, giving your e-liquid flavors more body.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Expertly Crafted Flavors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flavorings we use in our CBD vape products are often used in food-based applications, such as gelatins. These natural and artificial ingredients are safe to consume and, when combined well, can make some great flavors!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Last Word on CBD Fresh Mint Vape Pens</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our CBD Fresh Mint Vape Pens give you the cool flavor of mint, along with the “chill” of organic, broad spectrum CBD. And with our top-quality pens, you’ll get a reliable hit every time. Discreet and durable, they’re the perfect CBD product to take anywhere you go!</span></p>

This all-inclusive kit is good to go right out of the box, so you can start vaping right away. With an industry leading ceramic coil and glass/steel cartridge (with a temperature setting optimized for CBD vape oil), the CBDfx Vape Kit is guaranteed to give you the best possible vaping experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a CBD Vape Kit?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CBD Vape Kit is a vaporizer designed specifically to burn CBD vape oil, which has different chemical properties than other vape liquids. Regular vape mods burn at a higher temperature, which produces carcinogens and ruins the flavor when used for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This kit is specially optimized for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vape oils, allowing you maximum safety and enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our branded </span><b>CBD Vape Oil Kit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides you with all the parts and instructions you need to keep your device running smoothly. Within the vape device, there is a 1000mAh rechargeable  lithium battery, and each purchase includes a USB charger to ensure that your </span><b>CBD vaporizer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is always charged and ready for your vape sessions. A refillable cartridge is positioned towards the top of the vape device that utilizes stainless steel and glass material to deliver the best quality. Within the cartridge is a ceramic coil, allowing you to experience the pure flavor and a hefty amount of vapor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBDfx CBD Vape Kit comes in an ultra-compact design and weighs only 2 oz. Its small size gives the kit increased mobility without having to sacrifice power, and it can be used anywhere with uncomplicated single-button operation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Vaping CBD With a Kit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaping is the quickest way to feel the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-feel-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effects of CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the cannabinoids are absorbed through the lining of the lungs. This can take just a few minutes or even seconds, depending on personal </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioavailability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, disposable </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-facts-you-need-to-know-about-disposable-cbd-vape-pens/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD vape pens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a great grab-and-go option for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vape enthusiasts. Unlike vape pens, though, CBD vape kits are refillable. This can save you a great deal of money over the course of time, as you’re simply paying for e-juice refills rather than all-new pen devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vape kits also give you the option of mixing and matching your vape juices. With vape pens, you don’t have the option of topping off your Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Juice with a complementary flavor, like Strawberry Kiwi. With a vape kit, you can be your own mad scientist, concocting unique blends of CBD and THC e-liquids to enhance your vaping enjoyment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do You Use a CBD Vape Kit?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://help.cbdfx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062641993-How-do-I-turn-on-my-Vape-Kit-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use our CBD Vape Oil Kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, simply fill the cartridge with CBD e-liquid or juice, screw the connector ring on to the cartridge, and pop it in. The next step is powering up your vaporizer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to fully power the vape kit, locate the button on the kit and press it five times. It will need to be pressed very quickly (within three seconds). If you take too long between button presses, the device will not register that you are trying to turn it on. Once you’ve done this, you should then see the device power on and the light will blink pink/purple five times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the vape kit should be fully powered on. You should see the button illuminate blue for the length of the button press. Press and hold the button down for the length of the puff. Once you’ve finished your puff, simply release the button. It’s that simple!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you happen to drop or break your cartridge, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-vape-kit-cartridge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacement vape cartridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are inexpensive and easily replaceable.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Choose a CBDfx CBD Vape Kit?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all-in-one CBD Vape Kit conforms to CBDfx’s strictest attention to quality and detail, combining ultra-sleek looks with a compact body and premium materials.
