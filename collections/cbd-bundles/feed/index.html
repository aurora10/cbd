					<description><![CDATA[<strong>Our Delta-9 THC Gummies take full spectrum CBD and pack it with extra THC, taking it right up to the legal limit. These organic, vegan gummies come in two delicious formulations, each providing maximum THC wellness and relaxation benefits all in a tasty sweet. The Chill Chews Bundle gives you a bottle of each of our potent ∆9 THC gummy products: Berry Buzz Sativa THC Gummies for uplifting, creative vibes and Lemon Dream Indica THC Gummies for deep, blissful rest — making it the perfect combo for daytime relaxation and nighttime slumber!</strong>

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy, start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel the effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chill Chews THC Bundle contains 1 bottle of our Berry Buzz Sativa (500mg CBD/100mg THC) gummies and 1 bottle of our Lemon Dream Indica (500mg CBD/100mg THC/60mg melatonin) gummies. Twenty gummies per bottle with 5mg of delta-9 THC per gummy; one gummy per serving.</span></p>
<div class="hub-drug-tests-notice col-12 p-4 mb-3" style="border:1px solid red"><strong>Ingesting or inhaling products that contain delta-9 THC could result in the consumer failing a drug test for marijuana.</strong></div>

					<description><![CDATA[People have enjoyed the wellness effects of mushrooms for thousands of years. In our Mushroom + CBD Drops, we’ve added adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms to organic broad spectrum CBD for a unique and powerful wellness product. Our Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops give you a blast of energy through nootropic and adaptogenic cordyceps mushrooms, plus wellness-boosting chaga and lion’s mane. This potent tincture also features the “mother of all cannabinoids,” CBG, which intensifies the focusing effect of CBD. Our Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops combine broad spectrum CBD with CBN (the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”), and three stress-relieving adaptogens — reishi, maitake, and turkey tail mushrooms — to give you a wonderfully relaxing experience. Enjoy both of these ground-breaking tinctures in this cost-saving bundle!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Nighty Night Bundle is a 1-2-3 punch from the Sandman himself, with three powerful sleep products. Our Sweet Dreams Drops are a potent combination of full spectrum CBD, CBN (the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”), and sleep terpenes, plus the added boost of super-chill THC! Our Purple Punch Vape Pen also combines full spectrum CBD, CBN, and THC — but with the near-immediate effects of a vape pen. We’ve also included in this bundle the classic combination of CBD and melatonin in our popular CBD Sleep Gummies. All three products are designed with one thing in mind: to help you get to sleep quickly and help you sleep soundly through the night.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People tend to think of CBD as a relaxation product because of its calming properties, but combined with the right combination of ingredients it can actually be a great focus product, due to its ability to calm the mind. This makes CBD a wonderful addition to energy products like our Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops, Morning Capsules and Focus Shots. The mushroom drops give a blast of energy through nootropic and adaptogenic cordyceps mushrooms, plus wellness-boosting chaga and lion’s mane. This tasty tincture also features the “mother of all cannabinoids,” CBG, which intensifies CBD’s focusing effect. Our Morning Capsules add time-released caffeine and other energizing ingredients to the potent CBD-CBG cannabinoid combo. And our CBD Focus Shots combine time-released caffeine with L-arginine for healthy blood flow. Each of these products is a great way to start a productive day!]]></description>
