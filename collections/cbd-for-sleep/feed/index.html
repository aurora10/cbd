					<description><![CDATA[A good night’s sleep can be elusive. Our Sweet Dreams Drops help you get to sleep quickly and rest more soundly through the night. This powerful tincture combines full spectrum CBD with added CBN, the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid, sleep terpenes, and the maximum legal amount of delta-9 THC.

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong> Shake well before use. Place one full dropper (1mL) under the tongue and hold for one minute before swallowing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBN: Sweet Dreams Blend</h2>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> that are a result of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. In terms of calming, nothing beats the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” CBN, which is a vital component of our sleep tincture. <b>THC</b> also delivers relaxation benefits, as well as wellness benefits and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful (and natural) alternative to prescription sleeping pills and other drug store sleep aids.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil has a wonderful calming effect on the mind and body. CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” takes that calming effect to the next level with deep, restful properties. Delta-9 THC and sleep terpenes also help the mind and body to unwind before bed.</p>
<h3>Deeper Sleep</h3>
<p>Every ingredient in these delta-9 sleep drops is formulated to not only help you fall asleep, but to also sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions.</p>
<h3>No “Hangover”</h3>
<p>With most sleeping pills, you can wake up in the morning feeling groggy and just plain lousy. With our THC sleep oil, there are no ill after-effects. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>When CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, it helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, which include stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the CBD oil that is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Among the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> found in full spectrum CBD are CBD (of course), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are other THC cannabinoids (such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC), delta-9 is the version of THC that is most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. The full name of delta-9 is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has several wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is derived from the hemp plant (not marijuana) and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a CBD product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms (in the great state of Kentucky!), and extracted with clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and test results are made available to all visitors on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Sleep Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN, or THC products, always look for a lab report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent lab reports for all of their products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + THC oil and rest assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC oil is taken sublingually</a> — that is, absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries under the tongue — the effects are felt much more quickly than they are when you simply swallow the oil. If you simply swallow your tincture oil, the CBD, CBN and THC have to travel through your digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. If you take your CBD oil sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in the United States — in Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in cannabis hemp farming. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown hemp is pesticide-free and contains no GMOs. You can rest assured that your CBD product is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in products from less reputable CBD brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes carbon dioxide to extract the CBD oil from the cannabis hemp plant, leaving behind no potentially harmful solvents as with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the highly purified, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>

<p>All of our CBD and delta-9 products are quality tested by an independent, third-party lab. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers on the front page of our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>.

<h2>Sweet Dreams Are Made of This: Delta-9 THC Drops + CBN</h2>
<p>Our Delta 9 Sweet Dreams oil drops are the finest in natural sleep supplements. Featuring organic full spectrum CBD, CBN (the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid), delta-9 THC, and sleep terpenes, this tincture is formulated to not only get you to sleep quickly, but to help you sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions. Our delta-9 sleep tincture gives you all of these sleep benefits without the morning hangover that comes with many sleeping pills. Enjoy your best sleep ever with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>The Power of Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend begins with full spectrum CBD. As we mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the hemp plant, with no cannabis materials filtered out. This means full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the term used to describe the phenomenon in which the various compounds of the hemp plant — all of the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, CBN, THC, and the rest of the compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our CBN oil for sleep), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken alone.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Sleep Oil</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). This is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. Like other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, yes, delta-9 can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with a wealth of wellness benefits — and it has many restful properties that make it the perfect ingredient for a natural CBD sleep oil.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our oil extract after the THC has been measured and increased the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>CBN: The Ultimate Relaxation Cannabinoid</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, better known as CBN, is one of the most famous and important of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of THC, meaning that it is formed when the composition of THC is altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the intoxicating properties of THC, it does carry over the relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + CBN + THC for Sleep</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 products (including our sleep tincture and chill tincture) is formulated with your health in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible and to help you on your journey to better living. Our full spectrum sleep oil can help you get a better night’s sleep, which is vital for good health. We wish you all the best on your wellness journey!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our CBD Oil Sleep Tincture blends rich broad spectrum CBD, CBN (the “relaxation cannabinoid”), special sleep terpenes, and melatonin to give you the ultimate deep sleep experience. This CBD sleep tincture is available in a 30mL bottle, regular strength (1000mg CBD &#38; 150mg CBN); in a larger 60mL bottle, extra strength (2000mg CBD &#38; 300mg CBN); and then in a larger 120mL bottle, maximum strength (4000mg CBD &#38; 600mg CBN).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>CBD Oil Sleep Tincture</strong></h2>
<p>Nothing beats a good night’s sleep. It allows your body to repair itself and release harmful toxins, as well as other wellness-enhancing benefits. But sometimes, we need help to get the full eight hours we all so desperately need. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-sleep/">CBD Sleep Tinctures</a> offer a generous serving of calming broad spectrum CBD — up to 33mg per serving — paired with CBN, commonly known as the “relaxation cannabinoid,” and Melatonin. Together, they create a powerful CBD Sleep Tincture to help even the most restless sleeper get a better night’s rest. And, unlike many tinctures on the market today, our CBD Sleep Tinctures have a delightful flavor.</p>
<p>Added to this CBD oil for sleep is a blend of terpenes, specially formulated to enhance restful sleep. Our CBD Oil Sleep Tincture also includes MCT oil, which enhances the bioavailability of the CBD in your bloodstream, in addition to its own wellness-enhancing properties. But that’s not all. We’ve even added 5mg of melatonin to every serving, so that you’ll not only find it easier to drift off, but also you’ll be able to stay asleep without waking up off and on during the night. And the best part is, with our all-natural, non-addictive CBD sleep tinctures, you won’t have to deal with the groggy after-effects people often encounter with prescription sleeping pills.</p>
<p>And because not everyone has the same needs or tolerances, we’re offering these CBD drops for sleep in three different formulations: in a 30mL bottle, you’ll find regular strength (1000mg CBD &amp; 150mg CBN); in a larger 60mL bottle, we offer a extra strength (2000mg CBD &amp; 300mg CBN); and then in a larger 120mL bottle, we offer a maximum strength (4000mg CBD &amp; 600mg CBN).</p>
<h3><strong>CBN Tinctures for Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>CBN, or cannabinol, is a minor cannabinoid and a derivative of THC. When THC ages, it becomes CBN. But unlike its parent compound, CBN is a non-psychoactive, so it does not get you “high.” Furthermore, CBN has many wellness benefits, the most notable being the calming effect it has on the body and mind. This calming effect makes it easier to unwind your mind to prepare you for sleep and is one of the main reasons why CBN tinctures for sleep are such a popular choice for those suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>Similar to the way other cannabinoids work in the body’s endocannabinoid system, CBN binds to CB1 receptors. The result is a deep restfulness of the body and mind. This physiological effect tells the body it’s time for sleep.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Include CBD + CBN Oil in the Sleep Tincture?</strong></h3>
<p>On its own, CBD is a powerful and effective compound that impacts positively on the body’s endocannabinoid system, which regulates and balances sleep, immune response, communication between cells, appetite and metabolism, memory, and other vital processes. When CBD is combined with other cannabinoids, such as CBN, it produces what is known as the Entourage Effect. In essence, each cannabinoid increases the effectiveness of the other. When terpenes are added to the mix, that effectiveness grows even stronger.</p>
<h3><strong>CBD Drops for Sleep Rate for Quality &amp; Purity</strong></h3>
<p>At CBDfx, all of our hemp is grown right here in the U.S.A., in the richly soiled hills of Kentucky. We choose only the best hemp plants for our CBD oil production: 100% organic and lab-tested by a third-party for exceptional quality and transparency. All of our CBD Oil Tinctures are made to exacting standards, containing only natural, plant-based ingredients to give you the most effective experience possible.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> This product will cause extreme drowsiness and/or sleepiness. Do not take when driving, operating heavy machinery, or engaging in any activity that requires alertness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">CBD + CBN Oil Calming Tincture</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A New Take on Our Classic CBD Tincture Oils:</p>
<p>Welcome to the state of calm with our CBN + CBD Oil Tincture.</p>
<p>Taking what you loved about our classic <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/">CBD Tinctures</a>, we’ve updated them to enhance their flavor (now delightfully herbaceous <span style="font-weight: 400;">with no “hempy” after taste</span>) while adding CBN! From Classic to Calming, our latest tincture iteration marks a new step forward for an old favorite!</p>
<p>With more than 27% of Americans suffering from some form of sleep disorder, it’s no surprise that getting a good night’s sleep has become harder than ever. Not only does a lack of sleep leave us tired and groggy the following day, but it’s also incredibly detrimental to our health.</p>
<p>To cater to your needs, tolerance, and preference, our CBD + CBN Calming Tinctures are available in a variety of strengths from extra strength (1000mg), maximum strength (2000mg), maximum strength plus (4000mg), and ultra strength (6000mg).</p>
<h2>What is CBN?</h2>
<p>Unfamiliar to many hemp users, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a> is a naturally occuring minor cannabinoid and a derivative of THC.</p>
<h3>The Role of Sleep on Health:</h3>
<p>Everybody needs to sleep. Unfortunately, sleep doesn’t always come easy when we ask for it. Whether it’s stress, anxiety, or depression, there are a variety of factors that can make sleep more difficult than we’re used to. To add insult to injury, sleep can also have serious effects on our health, affecting even our immune system.</p>
<h3>Why Should You Try Our CBN + CBD Tincture Oil?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the fact that it’s made from natural ingredients, our CBD + CBN Calming Tinctures work to help you sleep without leaving you feeling groggy the next morning. That means no strange physiological responses or dreams, just pure and natural sleep. Our CBD products are non-addictive and non-habit forming, so you can use them without worry and be able to rest easily. </span></p>
<h3>Made In The U.S.A</h3>
<p>Thanks to the healthy soil and farming practices found right here in the U.S.A., we’re proud to say that our hemp is home-grown in the hills of Kentucky. Choosing only the best hemp plants for CBD production, our hemp is 100% organic and selected for its exceptional quality every time.</p>
<p>This product may cause drowsiness and/or sleepiness; do not take when driving, operating heavy machinery or engaging in any activity that requires alertness.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Benefits of CBD Gummies for Sleep</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies for Sleep</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> are an effective natural </span><b>sleep aid</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, formulated to tackle insomnia and give you a full night’s rest. With organic </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, melatonin and all-natural ingredients, these delicious hemp gummies are a safe, effective and natural alternative to traditional sleeping pills, which can potentially become habitual and can leave you with an unpleasant hangover feeling in the morning. With </span><b>CBD Sleep Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, you’ll awaken refreshed, renewed, and ready to take on your day!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Sleep begin with organic broad spectrum CBD. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabidiol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) has many healthful properties due to its interaction with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The endocannabinoid system helps to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in various systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and brain. This helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as mood, memory, stress, immune, inflammation, appetite, pain, motor control and, yes, the body’s ability to regulate sleep cycles. It’s CBD’s interaction with receptors that control the sleep cycle that produces a feeling of gentle relaxation when you take CBD products. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-sleep-beating-insomnia-the-natural-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD for sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> can be an especially effective supplement, if blended with other natural sleep ingredients.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Using Melatonin With CBD</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain and released into the bloodstream to help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. People have taken over-the-counter melatonin supplements for decades to complement the body’s sometimes inadequate production of this restful hormone. Melatonin is an ideal supplement to combine with CBD, since both ingredients simply help the body do what it’s already doing — only more efficiently. Make sure not to drive or operate heavy machinery when taking a melatonin product, as melatonin may cause drowsiness.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Are Terpenes?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are phytocompounds that give plants their scent, and do everything from encouraging pollination to warning away pests. For humans, these compounds have often been found to have beneficial wellness effects. In fact, terpenes form the basis of many essential oils, and are used in holistic treatments, such as aromatherapy. Some terpenes, such as those found in lavender and yes, cannabis, have been found to relax the mind and body.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terpenes can also contribute to the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which is a term used to describe the phenomenon by which </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and other </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> compounds bolster each other’s effects when consumed together. This means the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in these vegan CBD gummies makes the sleep terpenes work harder for you and those very same terpenes make your calming CBD more effective, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Other Restful Ingredients</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies with Melatonin</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Sleep contain several restful ingredients to regulate sleep cycles and maximize your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-sleep-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> experience. Magnesium has been shown to help the mind and body unwind and relax. Likewise, the botanical extracts used in these gummies — from passion flower, lemon balm, and chamomile — also give a calming effect that helps to prepare the body for rest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With broad spectrum CBD, restful melatonin and magnesium, plus a potent blend of calming botanicals and sleep terpenes, our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-the-best-cbd-gummies-for-sleep/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD Gummies for Sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are a tasty way to send you off to Dreamland!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why Are CBDfx Hemp Gummies the Best?</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"> CBD + CBN Night Capsules For Sleep &#8211;  Vegan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perfect just before bed, our CBD + CBN Night Capsules help place your mind and body at ease, preparing it for a night of restful and relaxing sleep.</p>
<p>Combining the benefits of CO2-extracted, non-GMO, vegan, and 100% organic CBD + CBN oil, our Night Capsules bring you the calming-inducing benefits of CBD and take them a step further with the “Entourage Effect” brought with the inclusion of high-potency CBN. Working in tandem, both cannabinoids work to produce a greater sense of calm both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsules also include a host of natural extracts and botanicals that serve to heighten the effects of more restful sleep. These include organic Valerian Root, GABA, Magnesium, and a specialized-blend of terpenes that serve to calm the mind and tire the body to make getting to bed easier than ever, and sleep more restful and energizing.</p>
<p>When all combined, this <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-sleep/">CBD sleep aid</a> give your body everything it needs to relax, destress, and prepare for sleep without the added side effects typically associated with prescription medication or over-the-counter sleep aids.</p>
<p>Each of our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsule for sleep bottles come in at 900mg (60ct, 30mg per serving) to bring you a more restful sleeping experience.</p>
<h2>WAIT, WHAT IS CBN?</h2>
<p>As a lesser known cannabinoid, the prominence of Cannabinol (CBN) can fly under the radar of even the most-experienced CBD users. However, as a minor cannabinoid—along with other cannabinoids such as CBD, CBG, etc.—CBN can have profound effects on the body, particularly in conjunction with other cannabinoids to produce the “Entourage Effect.”</p>
<p>A natural derivative of “aged” THC, CBN is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid known for its natural sleep-enhancing properties. In conjunction with CBD, CBN binds to the brain’s CB1 receptors to produce a calming effect, promoting easier, longer, and more restful sleep in the body.</p>
<h2>WHY SHOULD I TRY THE CBD + CBN NIGHT CAPSULES?</h2>
<p>If you ever have trouble sleeping—and most Americans do—they can be an incredible asset for getting yourself to sleep easier than ever.</p>
<p>Our days at work or at school can be long and hard, and although we might be physically and mentally exhausted by the time we’re ready for bed, sometimes our minds are still going. In these cases, getting to sleep can be difficult, and worse still, staying up can cause us to be groggy and fatigued come morning, making the day’s challenges that much harder to take on.</p>
<p>Instead of tossing and turning, waiting for yourself to get tired, it’s better to use a natural sleep aid to prepare your brain for bed when you need it most.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsules achieve just that, utilizing the natural calming effects of CBD and CBN, combined, and adding a host of other natural sleep-enhancing botanicals to make getting to sleep easier and more energizing.</p>
<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
<p>Like other cannabinoids, CBN works to bind to the brain’s key receptions (CB1, CB2, or both) to produce physiological reactions in the body. These reactions are commonly understood to produce a greater sense of calm in the mind and body, allowing more restful sleep for those ready for bed.</p>
<h3>MADE IN THE U.S.A</h3>
<p>There are only a few countries in the world producing industrial-grade hemp at the quality and scope required for effective and beneficial CBD products.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we’re proud to say that the hemp we use is grown right here in the U.S.</p>
<p>With a complete dedication to the service of our customers, our products are made exclusively from the finest-quality hemp, extraction, and testing practices in the world.</p>
<p>Our hemp crops and oils are 100% organic, non-GMO, pesticide-free, vegan, and extracted using one of the cleanest and most-efficient processing methods in the industry (CO2 extraction).</p>
<p>We also stamp each and every one of our products with a trackable QR code linking them to their individual lab report, giving you the peace of mind to know when, how, and where your products were.</p>
<p><strong>This product may cause drowsiness and/or sleepiness; do not take when driving, operating heavy machinery or engaging in any activity that requires alertness.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<strong>Enjoy the deep relaxation of delta-9 THC and the sleep-inducing magic of melatonin in these blissful Lemon Dream THC Gummies! Our lemon ginger-flavored gummies are formulated to give you all the relaxing “chill” of a good indica, but with legal levels of THC. The tasty THC chews also provide the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD to help you get a good night’s sleep. One gummy per serving, 20 servings per bottle.</strong>

Looking for a day-use, lower dose delta-9 THC gummy? <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-gummies-berry-buzz-sativa/">Berry Buzz</a> comes with 25mg of full spectrum CBD and 5mg THC per serving.

How about a stronger THC gummy? Try our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cbd-gummies-magic-melon-sativa/">Delta-9 THC Magic Melon Gummies</a> or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cbd-gummies-pumpkin-spice-sativa/">Limited-Edition Delta-9 THC Pumpkin Spice Gummies</a>; both with 30mg of full spectrum CBD and 10mg of THC per serving.

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our THC + CBD Gummies: Indica Blend</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with the endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">homeostasis</a> (balance) in several crucial systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and the brain. This interaction helps to regulate such functions as sleep, memory, mood, appetite, motor control, pain and stress management, and much more. These effects are what make CBD such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD, which is the CBD oil used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Gummies, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids of the hemp plant. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus wonderful relaxation effects (especially in indica strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies).</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have gentle calming benefits for the mind and body, as does natural melatonin. Delta-9 THC, particularly in indica cannabis strains, has a deep, restful quality to it, as well!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies, have long been used to help with sleep. With additional full spectrum CBD and melatonin, these delta-9 gummies can be a wonderful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. Delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>The oil that is initially extracted from the hemp plant contains all of the chemical content of the hemp buds, leaves, and stalks. This includes wellness-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In fact, there are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). This robust and healthful hemp oil is called full spectrum CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>A curious thing happens when CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together. Instead of merely working in parallel with one another, CBD and the various cannabinoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a big reason why many CBD users prefer the rich cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana (it’s the one that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC. While delta-9 can get you high if you take enough of it, this THC compound also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. All THC used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC line of products is derived from hemp, and falls within the legal threshold of less than 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We mentioned all of those cannabinoids working together to bolster each other’s effects. Don’t forget that THC is a cannabinoid and, yes, delta-9 does work to make your CBD effects more pronounced — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>While there is some disagreement within the scientific community about exactly how to classify cannabis (some want to classify <i>all</i> cannabis as sativa), users have traditionally divided cannabis into three types, based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. These three types of cannabis are cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. Generally speaking, the effects of indica are largely observed to be relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made with organically grown hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including your full spectrum high potency THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as some cheaper extraction methods do.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD and THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a> which we provide for all of our products on our website. All of the best CBD brands provide such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their veracity. By reading these lab reports, you can verify that our CBD and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on the product label, and you can make sure that our products are pure and safe.</p>
<p>Because our products deliver in both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx CBD products to be the best CBD products, and our THC gummies to be the absolute <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” with CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>THC and CBD gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (you guessed it) you eat them. As a result, the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into your bloodstream through the digestive system. It takes longer to feel the effects of edibles, like CBD gummies and CBD cookies, than it does when you take CBD or THC as a sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of your THC gummy.</p>
<p>The good news is that edibles, like our THC gummies, stay in your bloodstream for much longer than vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel their effects for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your CBD or THC product.</p>
<h2>Explore Product Reviews, Ask a Question, or Shop Our Website</h2>
<p>Whether you’ve got a question for our CBDfx customer service team, want to leave a product review, or are just interested to read what others are saying about our CBD and THC delta products, our community is the place to be! You can also shop the best selection of CBD, mushroom, and delta-9 THC products anywhere on our CBDfx website!</p>

<h2>The Final Word on Our THC + CBD Gummies: Indica Blend</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our Lemon Dream THC Gummy) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. This delicious gummy is designed to help you relax, while enjoying all the wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and their cannabinoid companions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBN: Purple Punch Indica</h2>
<p>Due to its <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interaction with the endocannabinoid system</a><b>, CBD</b> has a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> for the mind and body. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the hemp plant’s <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only brings wellness benefits through its own interaction with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can be a wonderful natural relaxant — particularly with indica strains, such as Purple Punch. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a> (cannabinol) also has deep calming effects for users, which is why it’s often referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have a gentle calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, particularly in indica strains, has restful quality to it, as well — as does the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid, CBN!</p>

<p>Indica cannabis strains, like Purple Punch, have long been used to help with sleep. Combining Purple Punch delta-9 THC with full spectrum CBD and added CBN makes for a blissful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, sleep support, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the CBD oil that is extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD oil contains all of hemp’s healthful chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD (naturally), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 THC is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Tetrahydrocannabinol</a> is one of two major cannabinoids, the other one being CBD. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. If you take delta-9 in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC threshold established by law in the US.</p>
<h2>What Is CBN?</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, or CBN, is one of the most notable of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning it is formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the psychoactive properties of THC, it does carry over the deep relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) to such an extent that CBN is referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>There is some disagreement in the scientific community about how to distinguish the different types of cannabis. Some scientists classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others consider them as three distinct species. Whatever the case, cannabis users have traditionally separated cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer (for example, sativa strains add an uplifting feeling for the user). In general, the effects of indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits. Our Purple Punch cannabis CBN vape is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by US law.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">CBDfx product</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting highly rated, quality CBD. Every ml of our CBD oil is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with pure carbon dioxide. All of our CBD products — including Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If the Oil in My CBN + THC Vape Pen Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN or THC delta products, always look for a detailed report conducted by a third-party lab. Every reputable CBD or THC delta brand will provide independent laboratory reports for all of their CBD and delta cannabis products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency for our customers and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta cannabis product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + Delta-9 THC oil and be assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the CBD or THC Effects of a Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping THC or CBD</a> is the fastest way to experience the effects of the cannabinoids. This is due to the fact that the CBD and THC are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to eat, say, a CBD cookie or use a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you use a CBD or THC vape product, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes (or sooner), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the cannabis we use for our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> hemp products is grown in the United States, in the state of Kentucky. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown cannabis hemp contains no GMOs, and you can be assured that your CBD product is also free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals often found in CBD products from less reputable brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes carbon dioxide to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant. This method leaves behind no potentially harmful solvents, which can happen with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic CBD oil has been extracted from our cannabis hemp, we combine it with other natural ingredients — which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and THC delta products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. Lab reports for every product are made available on the front page of our website and via a QR code on the product label.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, which is derived from organically grown hemp and is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>.

<h2>Vaping Delta-9 Via the Purple Punch Indica Strain</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Purple Punch Disposable Vape Pens have deep and powerful relaxation benefits. Capturing the heavy calm of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, these THC vape pens give you the earthy flavor and chill of this classic indica, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. With a CBD THC pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles. In addition to all of this, you can also benefit from the wellness properties of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Using Full Spectrum CBD Oil in Vape Products</h2>
<p>The robust ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD oil” refers to CBD as it is directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of delta 9 THC or other materials filtered out. And so, full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, a powerful profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD delivers an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> for the user. Entourage Effect is the term for the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — the cannabinoids, the terpenes and the flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, CBN, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a product containing full spectrum CBD oil (such as our THC delta pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if you had taken it on its own.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens and the Role of THC</h3>
<p>As discussed, full spectrum CBD contains non-psychoactive trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like cannabidiol itself, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including muscle relaxation, sleep support, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids (like CBN), THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 can have psychoactive properties if you take a large enough dosage, but delta-9 THC can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC product line is to maximize the wellness potential of delta-9 THC. With the legal threshold of tetrahydrocannabinol content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve revisited our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we’ve increased the amount of delta-9 so that it’s much closer to the legal THC limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — such as our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant in the US, but it also allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vapes</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our THC vape pens) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. Our goal is to give our customers the best CBD experience possible. Our delta-9 THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while also enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with full spectrum CBD and the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We wish the very best for you on your wellness journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Purple Punch Indica </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><b>CBN + Delta-9 THC Purple Punch Indica Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers powerful relaxation benefits for the mind and body. Capturing the deep calming effects of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, this </span><b>THC vape juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the lip-smacking flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD and the potent cannabinoid, CBN, takes those effects to the next level. And with a </span><b>THC vape</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product, you can feel these blissful benefits almost immediately!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) has become incredibly popular because of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it delivers for the body and mind. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the ECS, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This interaction is especially powerful with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp compounds, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. One of those cannabinoids, </span><b>CBN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(cannabinol), has especially powerful sleep effects, which is why it’s commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” </span><b>Delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes heartily to both the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these three cannabinoids make a powerful combination to help you get the rest and joyous relaxation you desire.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD oil is the initial extract pulled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This potent oil contains all of the health-boosting chemical compounds of hemp, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. Cannabis contains </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 different cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the aforementioned CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and small, non-intoxicating amounts of delta-9 </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp can contain up to 0.3% THC under US law, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal limit. We know that many customers seek the full legal benefits of THC, and so we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products with them in mind. With our </span><b>THC vape oil</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other delta-9 products, we’ve added bonus delta-9 THC to the full spectrum CBD to give you maximum legal THC effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBN?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is among the most well known of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. Cannabinol is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning that it’s formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While it does not retain the psychoactive properties of delta-9 THC, CBN does carry over the deep relaxation effects of delta-9 THC to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant (along with CBD). This cannabinoid should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than tetrahydrocannabinol. Delta-9 THC does produce psychoactive effects, and if you take this compound in large enough quantities, it can definitely get you high. But delta-9 THC also produces several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, stress and pain management, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we use in our CBD + </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is all derived from hemp and is compliant under the 2018 US Farm Bill. This vape juice is not a marijuana product.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Indica?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some in the scientific community classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others disagree and consider them to be three distinct species. Cannabis users, though, have traditionally separated these three cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. Generally speaking, the effects of cannabis indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBN + THC Purple Punch Vape Juice is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by the US 2018 Farm Bill. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is CBDfx Delta-9 THC Vape Juice the Best You Can Buy?</span></h2>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Nighty Night Bundle is a 1-2-3 punch from the Sandman himself, with three powerful sleep products. Our Sweet Dreams Drops are a potent combination of full spectrum CBD, CBN (the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”), and sleep terpenes, plus the added boost of super-chill THC! Our Purple Punch Vape Pen also combines full spectrum CBD, CBN, and THC — but with the near-immediate effects of a vape pen. We’ve also included in this bundle the classic combination of CBD and melatonin in our popular CBD Sleep Gummies. All three products are designed with one thing in mind: to help you get to sleep quickly and help you sleep soundly through the night.]]></description>
