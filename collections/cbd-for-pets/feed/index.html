					<description><![CDATA[<strong>For natural, calming wellness, our Bacon-Flavored Pet Tinctures are a dog’s best friend. Combining organic and vegan ingredients with broad spectrum CBD and the delicious taste of bacon, our latest pet tinctures are perfect for pooches of all sizes.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBD Dog Tincture </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our organic, vegan CBD oil for dogs gives your pet all the benefits that humans enjoy from CBD oil, including calming properties, enhanced wellness, pain relief, and more!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs can get stressed by anything from a mail carrier to a car ride. Our CBD oil for dogs helps calm their nerves, so that they can live a happier life. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with receptors in your dog’s endocannabinoid system, bringing homeostasis (balance) to a variety of crucial organs and systems throughout the body.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint Relief</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many pet owners find that CBD can help soothe inflammation that causes joint and mobility pain in dogs, cats, and other pets.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does CBD Oil for Dogs Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All vertebrate animals have an </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-endocannabinoid-system-in-cats-and-dogs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cell-signaling system that interacts with other various systems and organs, most notably the brain and nervous system, and helps them to maintain homeostasis (or balance). </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other cannabis-derived compounds, called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mimic your dog’s own endocannabinoids. This interaction has the potential for many </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your pet, including support for sleep, mood, memory, stress, motor control, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does MCT Oil Do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium-chain triglyceride oil (or, MCT oil) improves your dog’s ability to absorb the CBD more quickly and thoroughly, which means your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-cbd-safe-for-pets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will enjoy the effects of the CBD tincture oil faster.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Buy a CBD Pet Tincture from CBDfx?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil used in all of our products is organically derived from hemp plants grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms. This </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD oil is extracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the hemp by means of clean CO2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And we back this up with a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third-party lab report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for every product we sell — even </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-dogs-a-complete-buying-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for dogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want you to rest assured that when you buy a CBDfx CBD product for your dog, it will be as potent as we claim on the label and the absolute purest, safest CBD pet product you can purchase. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take for Dogs to Feel the Effects of CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as every human has a different bioavailability rate — the amount and speed at which the body absorbs CBD — it’s the same for dogs. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-long-does-cbd-last-in-a-dogs-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioavailability factors that can affect your dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and other factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While humans can absorb CBD oil more quickly by holding it under our tongues so that the CBD can enter the bloodstream through the capillaries of the mouth, dogs will simply swallow the oil. This means that the CBD oil will have to travel through their digestive system before entering the bloodstream. This can take 30 minutes to two hours for humans, but can happen much quicker for your dog. On account of the faster metabolism in dogs, they can feel the effects of CBD oil in less than 90 minutes. And depending on your dog, it can be much sooner than that.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Last Word on Our CBD Pet Tincture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all love our dogs. CBDfx CBD Pet Tincture allows you to improve their quality of life by supporting their endocannabinoid system, as well as calming their nerves and even relieving some aches and pains in the muscles and joints. Try CBD Pet Tincture for your dog today and help them live their best lives!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consult with your veterinarian before use. Administer orally or mix into food. Give half a dropper in the morning and half a dropper at night. Store in a cool, dry place. Keep away from direct sunlight.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect for you if …</span></h2>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD Dog Tincture</h2>
<p>Our CBD oil for dogs contains several wellness benefits to help your dog live a happier, healthier life. And with our tail-wagging new chicken flavor, they’ll love to take it!</p>
<h3>Calming</h3>
<p>CBD has a gentle calming effect that relaxes the mind and body of your dog. This is great for many dogs, who get nervous and stressed out by loud noises, being left alone, and unfamiliar people or situations.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with your dog’s endocannabinoid system. The ECS helps your pet’s body to maintain balance (homeostasis) in several crucial systems and organs.</p>
<h3>Joint Relief</h3>
<p>Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, many find that CBD can help with inflammation that causes joint and mobility pain in dogs, cats, and other pets.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Oil Work for Dogs?</h2>
<p>Like all vertebrates (including humans), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/">dogs</a> have an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>. The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-endocannabinoid-system-in-cats-and-dogs/">endocannabinoid system</a> is a cell-signaling system that interacts with different systems and organs in the body, most notably the central and peripheral nervous systems, and helps them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/">CBD</a> and other cannabinoids mimic this process in your pet’s body, bringing many <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>.</p>
<h2>What Does MCT Oil Do?</h2>
<p>MCT oil (or, medium-chain triglyceride oil) helps your dog’s body to absorb the CBD more quickly and thoroughly, which means your <a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-cbd-safe-for-pets/">dog</a> will feel the effects of the CBD tincture oil faster.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx CBD Dog Tincture the Best CBD Oil for Dogs?</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">CBDfx</a>, we make sure all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> oil used in our products is organically derived from hemp plants grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>. We want you to know that when you buy a CBD product from us, such as our CBD Dog Tincture, it will be as potent as we claim on the label and the absolute purest, safest CBD product you can purchase.</p>
<h2>How Can I Know the Oil in My CBD Dog Tincture Is Organic?</h2>
<p>Always look for lab reports conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory, when you shop for CBD. Every reputable CBD company will provide such a report for its products. At CBDfx, we are happy to provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for each and every CBD product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD dog oil and be assured that you’re not buying a tincture full of pesticides, solvents, or other contaminants!</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD Oil in CBD Dog Tincture Come From?</h2>
<p>The hemp plants, from which we derive all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> oil used in our products, are grown in Kentucky, and are subject to the strict standards of the U.S. Government.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We only use organically grown, pesticide-free hemp, with no GMOs. This ensures that your CBD is free from all pesticides and other potentially harmful chemicals commonly found in CBD products from less reputable brands.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized CBD oil extraction process that utilizes clean CO2 to extract the oil from the hemp plant. CO2 extraction gives you a CBD oil free from solvent residues, as you might find in CBD products from brands that use cheaper extraction methods, and the potency you expect from a quality CBD oil.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the pure, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with only natural ingredients, which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD products — including CBD oil for dogs — are quality tested by an independent third-party laboratory. The lab results of these tests are made available for all of our customers. Just look for the link on the front page of our website to verify the purity and potency of our products.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD oil used in our CBD Dog Tincture is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, which comes from organically grown <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp plants</a> and is extracted by means of clean CO2. See how broad spectrum CBD oil compares to other types of CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD Oil</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Contains all the chemical compounds found in the buds, leaves, and stalks of the hemp plant, including THC (less than 0.3%).</p>
<h3>Broad Spectrum CBD Oil</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Detectable levels of THC have been filtered out, along with some other hemp content.</p>
<h3>CBD Isolate</h3>
<p>All other plant matter has been removed, leaving 99% pure CBD.</p>

<h2>Explore the Best Pet Blog for CBD — and More!</h2>
<p>Informative blog articles on our site keep you informed on products, like our CBD oil tincture for dogs, as well as other great topics on CBD, dogs, hemp, cannabis, cats, training, and more!</p>
<h2>Share the Wellness With CBD Oil for Dogs!</h2>
<p>Your overgrown puppy deserves the very best in life. Our CBD dog tinctures — and yes, there is a second <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-pets-hemp-oil-600mg/">CBD Oil for Dogs with bacon flavor</a>! — give your dog the gentle calming benefits of CBD, plus a boost of wellness in each tasty drop. Your dog’s CBD tinctures were formulated to ease their stress, improve their general wellness, soothe aches and pains in the joints that affect mobility, and give your dog a lasting sense of calm.</p>
<h2>Vegan Hemp CBD Oil for Dogs That Tastes Like Chicken!</h2>
<p>CBD for dogs isn’t always the tasty treat you hope it might be for your pet. There are plenty of pet tinctures on the market that aren’t appetizing at all for your dog. No one enjoys forcing a dose of any oil, let alone a hemp CBD oil, into their dog’s mouth. If your dog doesn’t see the drops of pet CBD oil as a treat, you’re unlikely to get them to take it. That’s why we formulated our organic CBD oil for dogs with a delicious natural flavoring and guaranteed results in the tail-wagging department. The best thing about the flavoring of our CBD oil products for dogs is that we only use vegan ingredients, yet our CBD hemp oil still tastes remarkably like real chicken. Whether your pet is a dog or a cat (and we do have delicious chicken-flavored oil CBD products for your cat, too!), your pet will certainly enjoy this delicious hemp product.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take for My Dog to Feel the Effects of CBD?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-long-does-cbd-last-in-a-dogs-system/">Every dog is different</a>, and so results may vary for every pet. There’s also the method of CBD delivery to consider. For humans, taking CBD as an oil can mean absorbing it sublingually, by holding the CBD oil under your tongue for 60 seconds before swallowing. This allows for rapid absorption of the CBD into the bloodstream through those capillaries. You’re probably not going to be able to train your dog to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, your dog will swallow the CBD oil for dogs and the CBD will be absorbed through your dog’s digestive tract. But while edible CBD products can take a human up to two hours to fully absorb, it’s not likely that your dog will take that long to feel the effects of the CBD. Dogs have a much faster metabolism than humans do, so your dog will naturally absorb the CBD faster. So, while it could take your dog up to 90 minutes to feel the effects of your CBD oil for dogs, it will likely be much sooner.</p>
<h2>The Last Word on Our CBD Dog Tincture</h2>
<p>We love our dogs, and we want them to live a happy, healthy life. Our organic CBD oil gives your dog gentle calmness to ease their nerves, and a wealth of wellness benefits. Consult with your veterinarian, and try <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-dogs-a-complete-buying-guide/">CBD for your dog</a> today. Help them live their best lives!</p>

We want you to know that when you buy a CBD product from us, such as our CBD Cat Tincture, it will be as potent as we claim on the label and the absolute <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-best-cbd-oil-for-cats/">purest, safest product you can buy</a>.</p>
<h2>How Can I Know the Oil in My CBD Cat Tincture Is Organic?</h2>
<p>Always look for lab reports conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory, when you’re shopping for CBD. Every reputable CBD company will provide such reports. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for each and every product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD cat oil and rest assured that it contains no contaminants!</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD Oil in CBD Cat Tincture Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in Kentucky, and our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the U.S. Government.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hemp we use is organically grown, pesticide-free, and contains no GMOs. This ensures that your CBD is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in CBD products from less reputable brands.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized extraction process that utilizes clean CO2 to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant, leaving behind no solvents as you might find in CBD products from brands that use cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic, highly purified CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with only natural ingredients, which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD products — including CBD oil for cats — are quality tested by an independent third-party laboratory. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers to see via a QR code on the CBD product packaging or on our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The organic CBD oil used in our <b>CBD Cat Tincture</b> is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, which comes from organically grown hemp and is extracted with clean CO2. See how broad spectrum oil compares to other types of CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Contains all the chemical compounds found in the buds, leaves, and stalks of the hemp plant, including THC (less than 0.3%).</p>
<h3>Broad Spectrum CBD</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Detectable levels of THC have been filtered out, along with some other hemp content.</p>

<h2>Show Your Feline Love With CBD Oil for Cats!</h2>
<p>Your feline friend deserves the very best in life. Our CBD cat tinctures — and yes, there is a second <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-for-cats/">CBD Oil for Cats with bacon flavor</a>! — give your cat wonderful CBD calming benefits, plus <a href="https://cbdfx.com/can-i-give-cbd-to-my-cat/">a wealth of wellness</a> in each and every one of these delicious drops. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/">Your cat’s CBD tinctures</a> were designed to ease their stress, improve their health and mobility, and give them a lasting sense of calm.</p>
<h2>Vegan Oil for Cats That Tastes Like Chicken!</h2>
<p>CBD for cats can be unpleasant, if you don’t consider your cat’s taste buds. No one enjoys forcing a dose of any oil, let alone a hemp CBD oil, into their cat’s mouth. If your cat doesn’t see the drops of pet CBD oil as treats, you’re bound to lose a finger! That’s why we formulated our organic CBD oil for cats with a delicious natural flavoring, guaranteed to water the mouth of even the most finicky of cats. The best thing about the flavoring of our CBD oil for cats is that this oil is a vegan product, yet still tastes remarkably like real chicken. Whether your pet is a cat or a dog (and we do have tasty oil CBD products for your dog, too!), your pet will certainly enjoy this delicious hemp product.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take for My Cat to Feel the Effects of CBD?</h2>
<p>Every cat is different, and so results may vary for every feline. There’s also the method of delivery to consider. For humans, taking CBD as an oil can mean absorbing it sublingually, by holding the oil under your tongue for a minute before swallowing. This allows for rapid absorption of the CBD into the bloodstream. Try explaining that to a cat!</p>
<p>Certainly, your CBD oil for cats will be swallowed and the CBD will be absorbed through the digestive tract. But while edible CBD can take a human up to two hours to fully kick in, it’s not likely that your cat will take that long to feel the effects of the CBD. Your cat has a much faster metabolism than a human, so the cat will naturally absorb the CBD faster. So, while it could take your cat up to 90 minutes to feel the effects of your CBD oil for cats, it will likely be much faster.</p>
<h2>The Last Word on Our CBD Cat Tincture</h2>
<p>We want our cats to enjoy life. We want our feline friends to be happy and healthy. Our CBD oil gives your cat gentle calmness to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cats-and-the-3-a-m-zoomies/">settle their nerves</a>, and all of the wellness benefits of CBD. We’re sure your cat will love it!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We love our cats. And when it comes to caring for the health and well-being of our feline companions, we’d do anything to keep them purring. Many veterinarians recommend CBD for cats, to improve their wellness and help calm their nerves. Our CBD oil tincture for cats is the perfect strength for their small size, and brings them all the same wellness benefits of CBD as it does to humans. Our CBD balm for cats soothes their dry skin and helps heal irritations, particularly on the paws and nose. Like all of our CBD products for pets, our CBD cat products are organic, vegan, and all-natural.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans have used </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/seeds-to-space-a-history-of-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp for centuries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for everything from rope and paper to medicinal applications. Hemp was even used in animal feed, as a low-priced, nutritious filler. In recent years, many hemp-derived products have focused on the wellness and calming aspects of CBD and other compounds called cannabinoids, which are found in abundance in the hemp plant. As a result, CBD’s popularity has exploded, with hemp-derived products as diverse as </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-gummies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD gummies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD tinctures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD topicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cookies-with-protein/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the market. One area that has grown greatly in recent years is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-pets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for pets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly dogs and cats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for cats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a no-brainer for a lot of cat owners, particularly when those kitties decide to turn the house into the Talladega Superspeedway at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 in the morning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But besides serving as a natural sleep aid for cats, there are other ways that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-cbd-safe-for-cats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD can help your feisty feline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CBD can relieve stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity, as well as boost their general wellness. CBD also has topical applications for cats, particularly with dry and irritated skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With both CBD oil for cats and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD balm for cats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available, CBD has become a must-have part of every cat owner’s pet supply pantry.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cats and Cannabinoids</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a protective cat parent, it’s natural to ask, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is CBD safe for cats&lt;/span<span style="font-weight: 400;">?” </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/can-i-give-cbd-to-my-cat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a resounding “yes.” While study on CBD and cannabis, in general, is still running in catch-up mode, </span><a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/faqs-about-cbd-use-pets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anecdotal evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is overwhelmingly positive. In order to better understand the effect of CBD on cats, perhaps it’s a good idea to provide a little background.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all mammals, felines have an </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/do-your-pets-have-an-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This system interacts with the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to regulate several key bodily functions, including mood, sleep, immunity, appetite, memory, pain management, and more. CBD (or cannabidiol) is one of a group of chemical compounds, called cannabinoids, that are found in the hemp plant. When consumed, these compounds bind to receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping to enhance its effectiveness in several of these key functions. Think of hemp-derived CBD as a safe, all-natural booster for one of your cat’s most vital systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, THC is a cannabinoid, too. And THC is not healthy for your pet. It should be avoided at all costs. Fortunately, CBD pet products all have below 0.1% THC levels, as required by the FDA. And unlike THC, cannabidiol is non-psychoactive, meaning it won’t get your cat “high.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Stress, Hyperactivity, and the Zoomies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cats can be … difficult</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of that is just good fun. They like to go nuts and run around. Some of it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard-wired into their nature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, the innate hunting schedule of a cat is between 3 and 5 in the morning — so there’s science behind their late-night insanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cats can also suffer from </span><a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/c_ct_fear_phobia_anxiety" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cat anxiety can manifest in lack of appetite, constant hiding, hypervigilance, and other ways. This can have long-term deleterious effects on their health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD calming products can ease their stress, and help them better integrate into your household and any other situation that might upset them, from energetic children to loud cars or fireworks. Our CBD Pet Tincture gives your cat the calming relief of broad spectrum CBD in a delicious, all-natural hemp oil, with the strength tailor-made for the size and weight of a cat. Mix it into their favorite food or feed it to them straight from the dropper. They’ll enjoy the flavor and, more importantly, they’ll experience the calming wellness benefits of CBD. One last note of importance: all of our CBD hemp oil for pets is organic, non-GMO, and vegan — so you can be assured you’re giving your BFF the very best.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dry and Cracked Skin</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cats can get dry skin for a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of different reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including dry air, poor grooming or bathing, nutritional deficiencies, and more. Their paw pads can also become irritated by rough or hot surfaces. If left unchecked, this dryness can cause cracked skin and even hair loss. That cracked skin can become inflamed or, worse, infected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your cat’s skin healthy and moisturized, try </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming and Moisturizing CBD Pet Balm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This balm for cats and dogs soothes and protects your kitty’s skin, alleviating discomfort and inflammation, and protecting them against future dryness. With broad spectrum CBD, odorless Alaskan salmon oil, soothing shea butter, and healthy essential oils, this CBD cat balm is a natural way to keep your feline friend happy and purring.</span></p>
<h3><b>Purity and Effectiveness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CBDfx, we use only the purest organic hemp to make our CBD products — including CBD for cats. All of our hemp is grown in the state of Kentucky and processed under the strict cannabis guidelines of the FDA. We use a third-party laboratory to test all of our products, and we make those </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/lab-reports/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available for everyone to see. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests show you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not only how much CBD and other ingredients are in your cannabis product, but they also tell you the levels of things that should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be in your product, like pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals that can be soaked up from the soil around the hemp plant or during the oil extraction process. With organic farming and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe CO2 extraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we provide you and your kitty with the safest, purest CBD products on the market.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm provides soothing relief for your dog or cat’s dry or inflamed skin, nose and paws. With 750mg of calming and wellness-enriching CBD, plus the multifaceted benefits of odorless Alaskan salmon oil and moisturizing shea butter, and a variety of gently comforting essential oils — lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile — it’s the perfect Pet CBD Balm.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm</h2>
<p>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm is a must for pet owners, who understand that their dog or cat deals with a variety of potentially serious skin issues, particularly on the nose and paws. This pet CBD balm protects and moisturizes the skin with all-natural ingredients, including organic broad spectrum CBD, harvested and processed right here in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Not only does this CBD balm for pets feature hemp-extracted CBD, but it also boasts additional hemp seed oil, which contains three healthy, polyunsaturated fatty acids: linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid. These fatty acids strengthen the skin, assist it in combating infection, and have multiple anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Our CBD pet balm features other key ingredients as well, which further enhance its effects. Odorless Alaskan salmon oil contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties, promote a healthy skin and coat, and have other wellness benefits. Shea butter moisturizes dry skin, reduces inflammation, and provides soothing relief to itchy and peeling skin. Candelilla wax hydrates and smoothes parched, scaly skin. And on top of all that, we’ve added a blend of lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile essential oils to nurture your dog or cat’s skin even further. Taken together, these ingredients provide welcome relief for pets suffering from skin issues.</p>
<h3>Why Does My Dog Need CBD Balm?</h3>
<p>It would be nice if our dog or cat could tell us when they’re irritated or hurting. Dog paws can be particularly sensitive. They harden and dry out for a variety of reasons, from aging to surface wear. When this happens, the paw pad skin can crack, which can easily lead to inflammation, infection, and general discomfort. Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm not only soothes the pain that accompanies this cracked skin, but also moisturizes, smoothes and protects the skin so that it can heal.</p>
<p>Dog noses are also prone to drying out, particularly in hot sun or cold weather — much like our human lips chap if we don’t protect them with lip balm. Given that dogs’ most powerful sense is smell, that sniffer gets an intense workout nearly every waking moment. So, keeping their nose hydrated and protected is a must.</p>
<p>Our CBD balm for pets can be used on any area of the skin that is reddened, irritated or inflamed. Just make sure to keep it away from your pupper’s eyes.</p>
<h3>Can I Use CBD Balm on My Cat?</h3>
<p>Because cats are so much smaller than the average dog, we sometimes forget that they can have similar health issues. As with dogs, a cat’s skin, paws and nose can dry out, and get irritated, inflamed or infected. So, it’s a good idea for cat owners to also keep CBD Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm on hand, so that their kitties’ pouncing peds and boopy noses remain hydrated and healthy.</p>
<h3>IS CBD Safe for Pets?</h3>
<p>Like humans and other mammals, dogs and cats have an endocannabinoid system, which regulates and balances sleep, immune response, communication between cells, appetite and metabolism, memory, and other vital processes. Their bodies, in fact, produce their own cannabinoids. The cannabinoids found in the hemp plant, known as phytocannabinoids, have been found to support and bolster this system, leading to a variety of wellness benefits.</p>
<p>And no, CBD won’t get your pet — or you — “high.” THC is the cannabinoid that provides the intoxicating effects everyone associates with marijuana. Because CBD is processed from the hemp plant, rather than from marijuana, it is nearly THC free — with legal amounts in CBD products at the nearly undetectable level of less than 0.3%. So, your dog or cat is not only safe in using this natural topical, but also they won’t be stumbling around your house because of it.</p>
<h3>How Does Alaskan Salmon Oil Help My Pet?</h3>
<p>Salmon oil is an incredibly nutrient-rich supplement. For years, humans have taken fish oil to support everything from heart health to immune function. This stems from two fatty acids that are readily available in the oil: omega-3 and omega-6 acids. For the skin, these fatty acids serve as an effective anti-inflammatory, as well as make the skin appear shiny and vibrant. The omega-3 acid known as eicosapentaenoic acid, in particular, produces arachidonic acid, which restricts the growth of pro-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p>Oh, and we agree that salmon can be pretty darned stinky around the house. That’s why our Alaskan salmon oil is processed to be completely odor-free, so you won’t have to worry about your pet offending.</p>
<h3>Your BFF Deserves Quality &amp; Purity</h3>

					<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our CBD Dog Treats for Muscle &#38; Joint offer gentle relief to older dogs as well as joint support for active dogs. Made with </span><b>organic broad spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, powerful </span><b>antioxidants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including blueberry, spinach, and parsley), and a host of other active ingredients, these safe and powerful CBD dog treats come in a tail-wagging sweet-potato flavor, sure to delight even the most finicky of pooches!</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply give your dog a muscle &amp; joint biscuit and let them eat it. If you’re concerned about how the </span><b>CBD dog treat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might affect your pet (particularly if you have a small dog), break it in half for the first serving and see if that suffices for your dog. If it appears that your dog is not getting all of the wellness benefits of their CBD biscuit, then bump the serving up to a full dog treat the next day. This </span><b>CBD pet product</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should only be used on adult dogs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBD Dog Treats for Muscle &amp; Joint</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-tips-to-help-your-dogs-joints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint pain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t just a problem for older dogs. It can be an issue for older dogs and active younger dogs alike. These joint issues can be developmental, or or they can be degenerative in origin. When this happens, the pain and discomfort can slow down your dog and make your pet’s life miserable.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><b>anti-inflammatory properties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help relieve aches and pains your dog may be experiencing. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/help-your-dog-relax-when-you-head-back-to-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> biscuits can be just the thing to get your dog up and moving again. </span></p>
<p><b>CBD Dog Treats for Joint and Mobility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are packed with effective natural ingredients. These tasty CBD dog treats contain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus other antioxidants and nutrients, including turmeric, for better joint health. Combined, these human-grade ingredients can help your dog live a happier, more comfortable life.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does CBD Work for Dogs?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs, like all vertebrate animals, have an endocannabinoid system. This cell-signaling system helps to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial organs and systems throughout your dog’s body. This helps to regulate such crucial functions as mood, memory, stress, sleep, pain, immune, and more. Cannabinoids (including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) help to boost the performance of the endocannabinoid system, and deliver wellness benefits throughout these various organs and systems, and help the body to better perform these vital functions. With anti-inflammatory benefits among these wonderful wellness effects, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide a potent ingredient in products for </span><b>joint and muscle pain in dogs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other pets.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Natural Ingredients in CBD Dog Treats for Muscle &amp; Joint</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to broad spectrum CBD, our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treats for muscle aches and joint health contain a variety of effective, natural, human-grade ingredients. Each of these tasty CBD dog treats includes powerful antioxidants — blueberry, spinach and parsley — plus anti-inflammatory superfood turmeric, and other ingredients to support joint health, including chondroitin and glucosamine. In addition, our CBD dog treats contain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a variety of adaptogenic mushrooms (reishi, shiitake, maitake, and lion’s mane!) which not only relieve stress on the mind, but also the body. We find these adaptogens so effective that we use nearly all of these mushrooms in our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD mushroom tinctures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for humans!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Are CBDfx Dog Treats the Best CBD Treats?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CBDfx, we use only organically grown hemp to make our CBD products. All of the hemp we use is American-grown and processed under the strict guidelines of the FDA. We also use a third-party lab to test all of our CBD products (including CBD dog treats and other pet products), and we make those </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/lab-reports/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available for all of our customers on our website. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These lab tests show you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not only how much CBD and other cannabinoids and ingredients are in your product, but they also tell you the levels of things that should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be in your product, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals that can be soaked up from the soil around the cannabis hemp plant or during the oil extraction process. With organic farming and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe CO2 extraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we provide you and your pet with the safest, purest CBD products on the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>

If you’re concerned about how the CBD treat might affect your dog (particularly if you have a smaller dog), break the dog biscuit in half for the first serving and see if that suffices for your dog.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBD Dog Treats for Stress &amp; Anxiety</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some </span><b>dogs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suffer from heightened nerves, which can make them seem overanxious and hyperactive. This tension can stem from a variety of factors, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/can-cbd-help-pets-with-stress-and-anxiety/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anxiety, over-excitement and the inability to self-regulate. This tension can increase stress in dogs and lead to full-on depression. Whether your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/help-your-dog-relax-when-you-head-back-to-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dog gets stressed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the mail carrier or from you leaving the house to head to the office, long-term stress can be bad for your dog’s overall health. Calming </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products can settle your dog’s nerves, and help your dog to relax during these types of stressful situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><b>CBD Dog Treats for Stress and Anxiety</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contain a host of safe, natural calming ingredients, including organic </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mood-boosting L-tryptophan and GABA, adaptogenic mushrooms to ease stress on the mind and body, and restful chamomile and passion flower. And your dog will love the natural sweet-potato flavoring! </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Dog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Treats for Stress and Anxiety are all-natural, organic, non-GMO, human-grade and vegan — so your dog is getting only the finest ingredients, both in purity and potency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its interaction with the nervous system, in particular, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help relax your dog and help your dog to better deal with stress.
