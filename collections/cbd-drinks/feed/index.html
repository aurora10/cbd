<h3>Finding It Difficult to Focus Lately?</h3>
<p>You aren’t alone.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance and expand, so are the daily distractions that we’re faced with. Whether it’s the water-resistant phone you take into the shower to listen to music, the phone you take to the bathroom to read articles, or the podcasts you listen to on the way home, we live in an era of constant content.</p>
<p>And to be frank, it’s difficult to disconnect—and when that happens we tend to overload our dopamine receptors to the point where we don’t want to do or focus on anything else but entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Need to write up a report due in 4 hours?<br />
</strong><em>“Let me just check the news one more time.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Got to meet up with your significant other for lunch?<br />
</strong>“I’ll just push the reservation back.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the problem?</p>
<p>When we overload our brains with various stimuli, we have a tendency to become a slave to them, robbing us of our focus, and making it more difficult to channel when we need it.</p>
<p>Not sure if you have a problem focusing on the task at hand?</p>
<p>Here are a few signs to look out for.</p>
<h3>Signs You Have a Hard Time Focusing</h3>
<p>We’ve all been there; a deadline is approaching but you <em>just</em> started rewatching <em>Breaking Bad</em> for the fifth time and want to watch a bit longer. An hour-long break turns to two, then six, then the next day, until you’re staring at a deadline that’s impossible to meet.</p>
<p>A few of the most common signs of concentration issues include&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of focus</li>
<li>Difficulty sitting still</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking clearly</li>
<li>Making careless mistakes</li>
<li>Inability to make decisions</li>
<li>Inability to perform complicated tasks</li>
<li>Lacking physical or mental energy to concentrate</li>
<li>Being unable to remember things that occurred a short time ago</li>
<li>Frequently losing things or difficulty remembering where things are</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that you know what to look for, it’s time to figure out the main culprit&#8230;</p>
<h3>Why Are We Losing Our Ability to Maintain Focus?</h3>
<p><strong>Overstimulation<br />
</strong>When you’re constantly being bombarded with options for entertainment—namely your phone—it’s hard not to opt for the easier distraction when facing a difficult task. Although this is human nature, overstimulation weakens your internal ability to say “no&#8221; to yourself and distractions. The solution? Back away from distractions and negative stimuli for an extended period of time to reset your dopamine levels.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Behavior Loops</strong><br />
Our brains are pretty miraculous, allowing us to continue to learn new skills and perspectives as we get older. However, the paths of our brains are strengthened by repetition, and when we make bad choices in behavior consistently, our brain defaults to those actions as the standard making them harder to unlearn.If you start your workday surfing the Internet instead of settling into your workload, you’re building bad behaviors that make focusing when you need it more difficult. The solution? Be aware of these actions, their consequences, and gradually try to change them.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking</strong><br />
This is a common one, we all want to get everything done at once. However, it’s been shown that for most people, multitasking is a terrible way to take on projects. Not only does it rob us of our focus by splitting it in multiple directions, but we also inadvertently train our brain to “start and stop.&#8221; The solution? Deep work. Set a timer that you will not break focus from your task for that allotted set of time. Stick to it and your ability to sit down and focus should improve.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s What Else You Can Do About It&#8230;</h3>
<p>Down a Pomegranate or Tropical CBD Focus Shot and get to work.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of things you can—and should—do to improve your focus for the long term, when you’re at work or school on the Monday after the weekend, a little extra energy and focus never hurt.</p>
<p>That’s why our Pomegranate and Tropical CBD Focus Shots are specifically formulated with calming CBD, energizing vitamins and nutrients, and finished with a delectable taste to make getting focused a delicious breeze.</p>
