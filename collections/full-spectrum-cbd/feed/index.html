										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, however, that if you’re new to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, you should consider trying half a gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the gummy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our </span><b>delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products (including our Magic Melon </span><b>THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious </span><b>sativa gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabidiol, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for short, interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeostasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (balance) in several vital systems and organs, including the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. This interaction between CBD and the ECS helps the various systems and organs to regulate important functions such as sleep, memory, motor control, immune, mood, appetite, stress and pain management, and more. These beneficial effects are the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement. </span></p>
<p><b>Full spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil, the oil used in our </span><b>Delta-9 THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (delta-9 THC) has a bevy of wellness benefits as well, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids produce multiple benefits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis connoisseurs generally associate sativa strains with feelings of exhilaration, mood enhancement, and creativity. This uplifting feeling provides a wonderful complement to the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil can have calming effects for the mind and body. Delta-9 THC also has deep restful qualities, making this cannabinoid combination ideal for long, relaxed “chill” sessions.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, CBD interacts with receptors in the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several of its most important systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol also carries a host of wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, soothing relief for pain and stress, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the extract initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust oil extract includes wellness-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and tiny traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by US law).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, instead of simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many CBD users prefer the power of full spectrum CBD oil products!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the cannabis compound that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana (it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, which are considered minor cannabinoids (meaning there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis). Delta-8 and delta-10 THC have somewhat different effects than the major cannabinoid, delta-9 THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While delta-9 THC can definitely get you high if you take it in large enough amounts, it also has several wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) only contain THC derived from hemp. All of these products are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects (via the Entourage Effect). And in a product featuring 30mg of CBD per serving, along with 10mg of THC, that means your two major cannabinoids will be working in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, giving you a deeper cannabinoid experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are scientists who classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three categories: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when you consume it. Sativa effects have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Magic Melon Sativa is formulated to share these effects, but is still compliant with legal THC limits. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every product </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold by CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is made with organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, THC and mushroom products (including high-potency delta-9 THC gummies) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD hemp oil has been extracted by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as with some cheaper extraction methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC and mushroom products by </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which accompany every product on our website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so that you can trust their accuracy. These reports allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. You can “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeostasis</a>, or balance, in several vital systems and organs.

Delta-9 THC (<strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids can produce multiple benefits.</p>

<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together, instead of merely working in parallel with one another, these compounds actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a major reason why many CBD customers prefer the robust cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid generally associated with the intoxicating, or psychoactive, effects of marijuana. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the one that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. While delta-9 THC can certainly get you high if you take enough of it, it also has several wellness benefits, including mood elevation, muscle relaxation, pain and stress management, sleep support, and more. All THC used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) is derived from hemp, and falls below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed how multiple cannabinoids work together to actually bolster each other’s effects (the Entourage Effect). Don’t forget that THC is also a cannabinoid and, as such, delta-9 can work to boost the effects of your CBD — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, though, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three types: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This separation is generally based on leaf shape and the effects the plant generates when you consume it. The effects of cannabis sativa have generally been observed to be mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), inspiration/creativity, and anxiety reduction. Our Berry Buzz Sativa blend is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established under US law.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD, THC, and mushroom product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including this full spectrum high potency delta-9 THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by means of clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as is the case with some cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, mushroom, and delta-9 THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a>, which we provide for every product on our website. All of the best CBD brands will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. These lab reports allow you to verify that our CBD, mushroom, and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on our website and on the product label.</p>
<p>Because our CBD and THC products deliver in terms of both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx to have the best CBD products, and consider our THC gummies to be the very <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>CBD and delta-9 THC gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (yes) you eat them. This means the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into the bloodstream through your digestive system. Because of this, it takes longer to feel the effects of CBD edibles, such as CBD gummies or CBD cookies, than it does when you take a CBD or THC sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of a THC gummy.</p>
<p>On the plus side, edibles like our THC gummies stay in your bloodstream for a much longer period of time than CBD vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel the effects of a CBD edible for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your delta-9 THC or CBD product.</p>

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our THC + CBD Gummies: Indica Blend</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with the endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">homeostasis</a> (balance) in several crucial systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and the brain. This interaction helps to regulate such functions as sleep, memory, mood, appetite, motor control, pain and stress management, and much more. These effects are what make CBD such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD, which is the CBD oil used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Gummies, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids of the hemp plant. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus wonderful relaxation effects (especially in indica strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies).</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have gentle calming benefits for the mind and body, as does natural melatonin. Delta-9 THC, particularly in indica cannabis strains, has a deep, restful quality to it, as well!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies, have long been used to help with sleep. With additional full spectrum CBD and melatonin, these delta-9 gummies can be a wonderful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. Delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>The oil that is initially extracted from the hemp plant contains all of the chemical content of the hemp buds, leaves, and stalks. This includes wellness-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In fact, there are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). This robust and healthful hemp oil is called full spectrum CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>A curious thing happens when CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together. Instead of merely working in parallel with one another, CBD and the various cannabinoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a big reason why many CBD users prefer the rich cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana (it’s the one that gets you high).

<h3>THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We mentioned all of those cannabinoids working together to bolster each other’s effects. Don’t forget that THC is a cannabinoid and, yes, delta-9 does work to make your CBD effects more pronounced — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>While there is some disagreement within the scientific community about exactly how to classify cannabis (some want to classify <i>all</i> cannabis as sativa), users have traditionally divided cannabis into three types, based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. These three types of cannabis are cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. Generally speaking, the effects of indica are largely observed to be relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownies</h2>
<p>CBD is well known for its abundant calming and wellness-boosting benefits, particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the hemp plant. <strong>THC</strong> (tetrahydrocannabinol) also delivers a wealth of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and mood enhancement. Together, these two potent cannabinoids make a perfect choice for those looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a>’s best-known benefits is a gentle calming effect that relaxes the mind and the body. This effect is especially notable in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including cannabinol (or CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”). Delta-9 THC raises the “chill” factor even more with additional restful effects.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because of the relaxation properties of full spectrum CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, this edible is also great for easing nervous tension and stress, which can lead to anxiety for some people.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most pronounced effects of delta-9 THC is mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Brownie Bliss is formulated to deliver a gently elevated peace of mind, plus bursts of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC has several health and wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain relief, immune benefits, antioxidant effects, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially derived from the buds (flower), leaves, and stalks of the cannabis <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the chemical compounds of the plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, and flavonoids. In addition to CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cannabinoids</a>, full spectrum CBD also contains small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are minor cannabinoids with “delta” in their names, such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, delta-9 is the type of THC that is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9 THC’s full name is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, yes, this THC compound can get you high if you take it in large enough quantities. But delta-9 also has a great number of health and wellness benefits, including everything from pain and stress management to muscle relaxation to mood elevation. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownie Bliss is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, it takes a little longer to feel the effects than it would if you used a vape product or sublingual oil. When you swallow your brownie edible, CBD, THC, and the rest of the cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before being absorbed into the bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, and metabolism, as well as other factors, including the amount of CBD or THC in your product. The benefit of THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>THC Bliss + Brownie Goodness</h2>
<p>Every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. It is our goal to provide you with the very highest quality in every CBD product you buy — both in purity and potency. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 brownie, and we wish you the very best on your journey to wellness.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among CBD’s many benefits is a wonderful calming effect that brings relaxation to the mind and body.

Tetrahydrocannabinol raises the relaxation factor with additional calming effects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress Relief</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol has several wellness benefits, too, including pain and stress relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-Lasting Effects</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t forget that pills are edibles, which means the cannabinoids stay in your system much longer than other methods of consumption, such as vaping or sublingual tinctures. While it can take 30 minutes to two hours for the effects of edibles to fully kick in (depending on bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, and tolerance), those effects can last as long as six to eight hours!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the CBD oil that is directly extracted from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust cannabis oil contains all of the chemical compounds of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabis hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In addition to CBD (cannabidiol), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other notable </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, full spectrum oil also contains trace amounts of THC (by law, less than 0.3%). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are similar naming conventions for a few minor cannabinoids (see: delta-8 and delta-10 THC), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9’s full name is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, it’s true that in large enough quantities, this compound can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC that we use in our Daily Microdose Cannabis Blend Pills is derived from the form of cannabis called hemp and adheres to legal thresholds required under US law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our products are designed for wellness and, as mentioned, fall within the US legal limits for tetrahydrocannabinol. Still, it is important to remember that this cannabis compound can potentially cause psychotropic effects. So, please don’t drive or operate heavy machinery when using these cannabis capsules.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Entourage Effect</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, they don’t merely work in parallel with one another. Instead, these cannabis cousins actually bolster each other’s effects. We call this phenomenon the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s a major reason why many CBD users prefer the healthful and robust cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like CBD, tetrahydrocannabinol is a major cannabinoid and, yes, it can absolutely contribute to the CBD Entourage Effect when they are taken together. The opposite is true, as well: CBD can make the effects of your delta-9 more pronounced, too!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Take THC Pills &amp; Microdosing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking delta-9 pills is simple. Just swallow your one-pill serving. This provides 25mg of full spectrum CBD and 2.5mg of time-release THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-guide-to-microdosing-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microdose THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’re not taking enough to feel the more pronounced effects of the compound. But with a low dosage, you can still take advantage of its many wellness benefits. With only 2.5mg of time-release THC per serving, these pills are ideal for microdosing. Still, it’s important to try these low-dose cannabis caps and get a sense of their effects before making them a part of your daily supplement regimen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted earlier, the effects of these cannabis oil capsules will take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, but should last six to eight hours — which is much longer than vaping or even tincture oil effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Are THC Pills Made?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people prefer to take delta-9 in capsule form, as for some a capsule provides easier digestion of oil. A capsule also provides a consistent dose every time. Our delta-9 caps contain only the finest ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase a product with the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> label, you can be assured that you’re getting top-quality CBD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also add natural, coconut-derived MCT oil, boosting absorption efficacy and providing you with a deeper delta-9 experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our CBD products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory, and all of those reports — called a </span><b>Certificate of Analysis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or COA — are made available to our customers on our website.

When you shop with CBDfx, you can rest assured that your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBD: Ultimate Chill Blend</h2>
<p>Along with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> associated with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the hemp plant. <b>THC</b> also delivers a host of wellness benefits, as well as relaxation and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful duo for those looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among the effects <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil is known for is a wonderful calming effect that relaxes the mind and body. This is due, in part, to the presence of CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” in the oil. Delta-9 THC Oil raises the relaxation factor with additional restful effects.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because of the relaxation benefits of full spectrum CBD, as well as THC, these oil drops are also great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of THC’s most pronounced effects is mood elevation. Lift your spirits and settle into a state of peaceful bliss with our Ultimate Chill Blend THC oil.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several crucial systems and organs. THC has several wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is CBD oil that contains all of the chemical compounds of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">the hemp plant</a>, including the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In addition to CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">other notable cannabinoids</a>, full spectrum also contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). Full spectrum CBD oil is directly extracted from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the hemp plant.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC Oil?</h2>
<p>While there are minor cannabinoids with THC in their name, such as <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-8 THC</a> and delta-10 THC, delta-9 is the type of THC that is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9’s full name is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, yes, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But delta-9 THC also has a wealth of wellness benefits, ranging from stress and pain management to muscle relaxation to mood elevation and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend is derived from the hemp plant and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>How Can I Shop for the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">The CBDfx label</a> means that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted by clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and all tests are made available to our customers on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Tincture Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD or THC products, you should always look for a laboratory report conducted by an independent, third-party lab. Every reputable CBD brand will provide these reports. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD + THC Oil and rest assured that it contains no contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the CBD Effects of a Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC is taken sublingually</a> — that is, held under the tongue and absorbed through the capillaries into the bloodstream — the effects are felt much more quickly than if you simply swallow it. If you just swallow your tincture, the CBD and THC have to travel through the digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. Sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on factors such as your weight, height, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in Delta-9 THC Drops + CBD: Ultimate Chill Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is American-grown in the state of Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in hemp farming. All of our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hemp we use is organically grown and pesticide-free, with no GMOs. This ensures that your CBD is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in less reputable CBD products.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes clean CO2 to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant, leaving behind no solvents as with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic, highly purified CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients, which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers to see on our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, which is derived from organically grown hemp and is extracted by means of clean CO2. See how full spectrum oil compares to other types of CBD.<br />

<h2>Ease Your Stress With Delta-9 THC Drops + CBD: Ultimate Chill Blend</h2>
<p>Our Ultimate Chill Drops allow you to dial back your stress and relax. With the added boost of delta-9 THC, this THC tincture delivers total body relaxation with a deep sense of peace. And the ingredients are as pure as the experience itself, with only organic CBD oil, coconut-derived MCT oil, and natural blueberry flavor. Embrace your inner “chill” with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>A Deep Dive Into Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>Understanding the wellness benefits of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend begins with understanding just what full spectrum CBD is. As we noted above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the cannabis hemp plant, with none of the plant materials filtered out. This means the oil contains all of the cannabinoids from the hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC. Full spectrum CBD also contains healthful terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the phenomenon in which the different compounds of the hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD and the other compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would on its own.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD + THC</h3>
<p>We mentioned that full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC). This is the legal threshold for THC content, and is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. THC also contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, while delta-9 certainly can have intoxicating properties if taken in a high enough dosage, delta-9 can also help you to achieve some of your wellness goals.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of THC products is to maximize that potential. With the legal threshold of THC content at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our extract after the THC has been measured and bumped up the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible. So, consider this THC legal THC and consider these products THC products you can use to boost your wellness potential!</p>
<h2>Go for Quality</h2>
<p>The tinctures top brands sell come with the guarantee of an independent third-party lab report. When you shop an online store for delta-9 (or really, any THC or CBD product), make sure your delta-9 product comes with such a report. This will tell you the exact mg of CBD, the exact mg of THC, and the exact mg of pretty much every cannabinoid and other compound. Additionally, the report will tell you which companies or brands are not using organic delta-9, as they will show (again, down to the mg), the amount of contaminants in your delta-9 product. Likewise, if your delta-9 product was not extracted with clean CO2 (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">as we use at CBDfx</a>), you will see the mg of chemical solvent residues, as well. For purity and potency, insist on CBD and delta-9 products that come with reports from independent, third-party labs. If a company doesn’t provide such reports, avoid their products!</p>
<h2>The Last Word on Delta-9 Chill Drops</h2>
<p>Consider our delta-9 family of products THC products you can trust. Each of these products (including our Chill Tinctures and Sleep Tinctures) is formulated with your health in mind. We consider daily health regimens vital for living your best life. And the best life requires the best supplement products.</p>
<p>You’re probably reading everything you can on product quality, what’s legal and what’s not legal, and what sort of dose you should be using for your wellness products. We get it. We understand that there are a lot of facts to be learned, as well as a sizable level of misinformation to be ignored.</p>
<p>We’re in this together, and we promise to give you only the best in CBD and THC, so that you can meet and exceed your wellness goals!</p>
<h2>Read Product Reviews or Ask a Question</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBN: Sweet Dreams Blend</h2>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> that are a result of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. In terms of calming, nothing beats the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” CBN, which is a vital component of our sleep tincture. <b>THC</b> also delivers relaxation benefits, as well as wellness benefits and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful (and natural) alternative to prescription sleeping pills and other drug store sleep aids.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil has a wonderful calming effect on the mind and body. CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” takes that calming effect to the next level with deep, restful properties. Delta-9 THC and sleep terpenes also help the mind and body to unwind before bed.</p>
<h3>Deeper Sleep</h3>
<p>Every ingredient in these delta-9 sleep drops is formulated to not only help you fall asleep, but to also sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions.</p>
<h3>No “Hangover”</h3>
<p>With most sleeping pills, you can wake up in the morning feeling groggy and just plain lousy. With our THC sleep oil, there are no ill after-effects. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>When CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, it helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, which include stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the CBD oil that is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Among the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> found in full spectrum CBD are CBD (of course), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are other THC cannabinoids (such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC), delta-9 is the version of THC that is most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. The full name of delta-9 is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has several wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is derived from the hemp plant (not marijuana) and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a CBD product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms (in the great state of Kentucky!), and extracted with clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and test results are made available to all visitors on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Sleep Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN, or THC products, always look for a lab report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent lab reports for all of their products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + THC oil and rest assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC oil is taken sublingually</a> — that is, absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries under the tongue — the effects are felt much more quickly than they are when you simply swallow the oil. If you simply swallow your tincture oil, the CBD, CBN and THC have to travel through your digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. If you take your CBD oil sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in the United States — in Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in cannabis hemp farming. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>

<li aria-level="1">
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the highly purified, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>

<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>. See how full spectrum CBD oil compares to other types of CBD.<br />

<h2>Sweet Dreams Are Made of This: Delta-9 THC Drops + CBN</h2>
<p>Our Delta 9 Sweet Dreams oil drops are the finest in natural sleep supplements. Featuring organic full spectrum CBD, CBN (the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid), delta-9 THC, and sleep terpenes, this tincture is formulated to not only get you to sleep quickly, but to help you sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions. Our delta-9 sleep tincture gives you all of these sleep benefits without the morning hangover that comes with many sleeping pills. Enjoy your best sleep ever with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>The Power of Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend begins with full spectrum CBD. As we mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the hemp plant, with no cannabis materials filtered out. This means full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the term used to describe the phenomenon in which the various compounds of the hemp plant — all of the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, CBN, THC, and the rest of the compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our CBN oil for sleep), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken alone.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Sleep Oil</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). This is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. Like other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, yes, delta-9 can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with a wealth of wellness benefits — and it has many restful properties that make it the perfect ingredient for a natural CBD sleep oil.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our oil extract after the THC has been measured and increased the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>CBN: The Ultimate Relaxation Cannabinoid</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, better known as CBN, is one of the most famous and important of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of THC, meaning that it is formed when the composition of THC is altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the intoxicating properties of THC, it does carry over the relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + CBN + THC for Sleep</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 products (including our sleep tincture and chill tincture) is formulated with your health in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible and to help you on your journey to better living. Our full spectrum sleep oil can help you get a better night’s sleep, which is vital for good health. We wish you all the best on your wellness journey!</p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) is well known for its calming wellness benefits. Full spectrum CBD, containing all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cannabinoids</strong></a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>, is the most robust of all CBD oils and delivers the most powerful CBD experience. <strong>THC</strong> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong></a>) also delivers a bevy of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and blissful mood enhancement. Together, these two cannabinoids make an ideal choice for people looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among CBD’s best-known effects are its gentle calming properties that relax the mind and the body. This is especially notable when you take full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> raises the relaxation factor with additional “chill” properties.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD and delta-9 THC both deliver strong relaxation effects, this edible product works great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety for some people, if left unchecked.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most notable effects of delta-9 THC is epic mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Chocolate Chip Cookie is formulated to deliver a blissful peace of mind, plus waves of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with receptors in the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC also delivers many health and wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the most robust of all types of CBD oil. It is the unfiltered oil extract as it is initially derived from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves, and stalks. Full spectrum oil contains all of hemp’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. This includes such notable compounds as CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there is such a thing as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, these are considered “minor cannabinoids,” meaning they only occur in the tiniest quantities in cannabis. Delta-9 THC, on the other hand, is a major cannabinoid and is the psychoactive compound most associated with cannabis. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the compound that is known for getting you high if you take enough of it (as with marijuana). But delta-9 THC also has a number of health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p>It takes a bit longer to feel the effects <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, compared to a vape product or sublingual oil. This is because, when you swallow your cookie, the CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, tolerance, and metabolism, as well as the amount of CBD or THC in your edible product. The benefit of taking THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer than other products, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>Our Most Potent Cookie Ever!</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 THC Chocolate Chip Cookie delivers 20mg each of full spectrum CBD and THC. This gives you two full servings of delta-9 bliss in every one of these delectable edibles. As with every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection, this cookie is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 cookie, and we wish you the very best on your wellness journey.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD is well known for its abundant calming and wellness properties, particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, and flavonoids of the hemp plant. </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) also delivers a host of wellness benefits, as well as relaxation and mood enhancement. Together, these two powerful cannabinoids make an ideal choice for those looking to “chill” the natural way. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the benefits </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is known for is a blissful calming effect that relaxes the mind and body. This is especially notable in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” Delta-9 THC raises the “chill” factor with additional restful effects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress Relief</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the relaxation benefits of full spectrum CBD, as well as THC, these oil drops are also great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Enhancement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most pronounced effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) is mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Birthday Cake Cookie is formulated to deliver a gently uplifting peace of mind.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several crucial systems and organs. THC has several wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the oil that is initially derived from the buds (flower), leaves, and stalks of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Full spectrum contains all of the chemical compounds of the plant, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In addition to CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, full spectrum CBD also contains trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are minor cannabinoids with names like delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, delta-9 is the type of THC that is the psychoactive compound that is most associated with marijuana. Delta-9 THC’s full name is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, it’s true, this THC compound can get you high if taken in large enough quantities. But delta-9 THC also has a great number of wellness benefits, including everything from pain and stress management to muscle relaxation to mood elevation. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookie is derived from the cannabis hemp plant and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Edible?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD or THC is consumed in edible form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it takes a little longer to feel the effects than it would if you used a CBD or THC vape product or sublingual oil tincture. When you swallow your cookie edible, the CBD and THC have to travel through the digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. This can take from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, like height, weight, and metabolism, and other factors, such as the amount of CBD or THC in your product. The benefit of CBD and THC edibles is that their effects last much longer — sometimes over six hours!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look to the Cookie!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. It is our goal to provide you with the very best in quality for every CBD product you buy — both in purity and potency.
