										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Maui Wowie Sativa </span></h2>
<p><b>Delta-9 THC Maui Wowie Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is perfect for kicking back and getting the most enjoyment out of your day. Evoking the pleasurable vibes of the legendary sativa Maui Wowie, this </span><b>delta-9 vape juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the flavor and mood elevation of a classic cannabis strain, but within the legal THC limits set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a vape product, you can feel these effects within minutes (sometimes seconds) — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles. On top of all that, you can experience the calming wellness effects of robust full spectrum CBD!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) is known for its many </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the mind and body, thanks to its </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interaction with the endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the healthful compounds of cannabis hemp, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it can also lend positive mood enhancement and feelings of exhilaration — particularly with sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie. CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a> also have natural calming properties that make a product, like our CBD + Delta-9 Sativa Vape Juice, great for uplifting your mood and even providing bursts of creativity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the oil that is directly extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant. This robust CBD oil contains all of hemp’s healthful chemical compounds, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. This includes </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%, by law).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp can contain up to 0.3% THC, full spectrum hemp extract can sometimes produce quite a bit less THC than that. Understanding that many customers want to enjoy the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products, where we add extra delta-9 THC back into the full spectrum CBD oil to give you maximum legal THC enjoyment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant, the other being CBD. Delta-9 THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) should not be confused with delta-8 and delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different properties than delta-9. Delta-9 THC does have psychoactive properties and if you take this compound in large enough quantities, it can get you high. But delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, as well, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we use in our CBD + Delta-9 </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC limits set forth in the 2018 US Farm Bill.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa, including ruderalis and indica. Cannabis users have traditionally separated types of cannabis based on leaf shape and the effects it generates when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation, creativity, and a reduction in stress and anxiety. Our Maui Wowie Sativa Vape Juice is formulated to deliver these effects, but within the THC limits established by US law. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of Vaping CBD &amp; THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><b>Vaping THC</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CBD is the fastest way to experience their effects. This is because the cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the lungs, which happens much quicker than if you were to take a CBD edible or sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-vaping-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vape THC and CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, CBD and THC tolerance, and metabolism.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is CBDfx THC Vape Juice the Best THC e-Liquid You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of our products are formulated with your safety and satisfaction in mind.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vape Juice: Wedding Cake Hybrid </span></h2>
<p><b>Delta-9 THC Wedding Cake Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the perfect combination of good vibes and gentle relaxation. Combining the uplifting mood effects of a sativa with the deep chill of an indica, this hybrid </span><b>THC vape liquid</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you a beautifully balanced delta-9 THC vape experience, within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill.

In addition to all of this, you can also enjoy the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD oil!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or cannabidiol) is renowned for its </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the body and mind, due to its interaction with the ECS, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the healthy chemical compounds of cannabis hemp, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including CBD and THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or tetrahydrocannabinol) not only contributes positively to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it can also add mood enhancement and gentle relaxation. It’s this combination of blissful effects that is particularly notable in cannabis hybrid strains, such as Wedding Cake.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the extract that is first derived from the buds, leaves and stems of the hemp plant. This robust CBD hemp oil contains all of the plant’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. This includes </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and small, non-intoxicating amounts of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp, by law, can contain up to 0.3% THC, full spectrum CBD oil can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limits. Understanding that many customers seek the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products. With our Delta-9 THC products, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to the full spectrum CBD extract to give you maximum legal THC effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a Cannabis Hybrid?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, cannabis users have classified the different types of cannabis on the basis of the plant’s leaf shape and the effects it delivers when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of a cannabis sativa are considered to include mood elevation, creativity, and stress/anxiety reduction. Cannabis indica is most known for its deep relaxation effects. Hybrid strains are created when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also cannabis ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part, hybrids refer to a combination of sativa and indica). Hybrid strains can deliver the most pleasing effects of both cannabis types, which is why hybrids, like Wedding Cake, are so popular with cannabis enthusiasts.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Purple Punch Indica </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><b>CBN + Delta-9 THC Purple Punch Indica Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers powerful relaxation benefits for the mind and body. Capturing the deep calming effects of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, this </span><b>THC vape juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the lip-smacking flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD and the potent cannabinoid, CBN, takes those effects to the next level. And with a </span><b>THC vape</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product, you can feel these blissful benefits almost immediately!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) has become incredibly popular because of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it delivers for the body and mind. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the ECS, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This interaction is especially powerful with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp compounds, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. One of those cannabinoids, </span><b>CBN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(cannabinol), has especially powerful sleep effects, which is why it’s commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” </span><b>Delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes heartily to both the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these three cannabinoids make a powerful combination to help you get the rest and joyous relaxation you desire.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD oil is the initial extract pulled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This potent oil contains all of the health-boosting chemical compounds of hemp, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. Cannabis contains </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 different cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the aforementioned CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and small, non-intoxicating amounts of delta-9 </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp can contain up to 0.3% THC under US law, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal limit. We know that many customers seek the full legal benefits of THC, and so we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products with them in mind. With our </span><b>THC vape oil</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other delta-9 products, we’ve added bonus delta-9 THC to the full spectrum CBD to give you maximum legal THC effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBN?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is among the most well known of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. Cannabinol is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning that it’s formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While it does not retain the psychoactive properties of delta-9 THC, CBN does carry over the deep relaxation effects of delta-9 THC to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant (along with CBD). This cannabinoid should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than tetrahydrocannabinol. Delta-9 THC does produce psychoactive effects, and if you take this compound in large enough quantities, it can definitely get you high. But delta-9 THC also produces several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, stress and pain management, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we use in our CBD + </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is all derived from hemp and is compliant under the 2018 US Farm Bill. This vape juice is not a marijuana product.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Indica?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some in the scientific community classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others disagree and consider them to be three distinct species. Cannabis users, though, have traditionally separated these three cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. Generally speaking, the effects of cannabis indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBN + THC Purple Punch Vape Juice is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by the US 2018 Farm Bill. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Pineapple Express Hybrid Vape Juice is formulated to give you the uplifting vibes of a good sativa combined with the deep relaxation of an indica — all within the legal limits for delta-9 THC! Along with the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD, it’s the perfect vape juice for a long, chill afternoon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Pineapple Express &#8211; Hybrid</h2>
<p><strong>Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Vape Juice</strong> is an ideal blend of good vibes and gentle relaxation. Combining the mood elevation of a sativa with the deep chill feel of an indica, this hybrid <strong>THC vape liquid</strong> gives you a wonderfully balanced delta-9 THC vape experience, within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. When you vape with this potent <strong>THC e-liquid</strong>, you can feel the effects of the cannabinoids almost immediately and enjoy one of the most popular (and famous!) cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition, you also get all the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> (or cannabidiol) is renowned for the many <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> it delivers to the body and mind as a result of its interaction with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which is the term used for the initial extract culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of cannabis hemp, containing all of hemp’s <strong>cannabinoids</strong> (including CBD and THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids.</p>
<p>Like CBD, <strong>THC</strong> (or tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes positively to the wellness benefits associated with the ECS, plus it can also add mood enhancement and relaxation. It’s this combination of blissful benefits that’s particularly notable in cannabis hybrid strains, such as the famous Pineapple Express.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of the hemp plant. This robust oil contains all of the hemp plant’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in hemp, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small, non-intoxicating levels of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limit, however. Understanding that many customers seek the maximum legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection of products. With our Delta-9 THC line, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to full spectrum CBD to give you maximum THC effects allowed by law.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* (tetrahydrocannabinol) is one of two major cannabinoid compounds produced by the cannabis plant. Delta-9 should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are considered minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9 THC. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* does have psychotropic effects and if you take it in large enough quantities, delta-9 can get you high.</p>
<p>But THC also has many health and wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, and more. The tetrahydrocannabinol we use in our <strong>THC Vape Juices</strong> is not derived from marijuana, but is instead derived from cannabis hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, cannabis enthusiasts have classified the different types of cannabis based on the plant’s leaf shape and the effects it delivers for the user. In general, the effects of a cannabis sativa strain are considered to include mood elevation, creativity, and reduction in stress and anxiety. Cannabis indica strains are most known for their deep relaxation effects. Hybrid cannabis strains are created when growers mix a sativa with an indica (there are cannabis ruderalis hybrids as well, but mostly, hybrids refer to a combination of sativa and indica). Hybrids can deliver the most pleasing aspects of both cannabis types, which is why strains like Pineapple Express are so popular with cannabis users.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Vape?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vaping THC</strong></a>, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds is the quickest way to experience their effects. This is because the various cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of your lungs, which occurs much faster than if you were to take a CBD edible or sublingual CBD oil. When you <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-vaping-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vape THC or CBD</a>, you can feel the effects in just a few minutes (sometimes even seconds), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, CBD or THC tolerance, metabolism, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx THC Vape Juice the Best THC E-Liquid You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDfx</a>, all of our products are created with your safety and satisfaction in mind. For this reason, we only use organic hemp for all of our CBD and THC products, and we extract the CBD oil from the hemp with clean carbon dioxide.

<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of CBD</a> (cannabidiol) for the body and mind have made it an incredibly popular wellness supplement. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially notable with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp’s health-boosting compounds, including all <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/"><strong>Delta-9 THC</strong></a> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes greatly to both the health and wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also delivers deep, blissful relaxation.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of the OG Kush Indica THC + CBD Vape Pen </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its positive effects on the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><b>, CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers a host of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the mind and body. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the hemp plant’s </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only brings wellness benefits through its own interaction with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can have wonderful relaxation effects — particularly with cannabis indica strains, such as OG Kush.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can have a gentle calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, particularly in indica strains, has a deep restful quality to it, as well. Together, they offer both the body and mind blissful relaxation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced Sleep</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indica cannabis strains, like OG Kush, have long been used to help with sleep. Combining OG Kush delta-9 THC with full spectrum CBD makes for a potent sleep product.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, sleep support, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the CBD oil that is extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD oil contains all of hemp’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD oil, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (naturally), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, in accordance with US law). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC is the cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoid compounds found in cannabis plants, the other one being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. If you take delta-9 THC in large enough quantities, this powerful cannabinoid can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: OG Kush Indica is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC threshold (less than 0.3%) established by US law.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Indica?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some disagreement within the scientific community about how to distinguish the different types of cannabis. Some scientists classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as cannabis sativa, while others consider them to be three distinct species. Whatever the case, cannabis users have traditionally distinguished different types of cannabis based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer (for example, sativa strains add an uplifting feeling for the user). In general, the effects of indica — as used in this vape pen — can be observed as deep relaxation for the mind and body, plus sleep benefits. Our OG Kush vape pen is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by US law. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can rest assured that you’re getting highly rated, quality CBD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Every ml of our CBD oil is derived exclusively from organic hemp plants grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with clean, efficient </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon dioxide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of our CBD products — including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third-party laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and those tests are all made available to the public on our website. We believe in transparency, as well as the purity and potency of our products! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Feel the CBD or THC Effects of a Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaping THC or CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the fastest way to experience the effects of these powerful cannabinoids. This is because the CBD and THC are absorbed into your bloodstream through the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to eat, say, a CBD cookie or use a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you use a CBD or delta-9 THC vape product, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes (or sooner), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Full Spectrum CBD Oil in Vape Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The robust ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: OG Kush Indica begins with full spectrum CBD oil. The term “full spectrum CBD oil” refers to CBD as it is directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of delta-9 THC or any other materials filtered out. And so, full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBN, CBC, CBG, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, healthful terpenes and flavonoids.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD delivers an experience known as the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the user. Entourage Effect is the term used to describe the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — the cannabinoids, the terpenes and the flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a product containing full spectrum CBD oil (such as our OG Kush THC delta pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if you had taken it on its own.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum Delta-9 Vape Pens and the Role of THC</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed, full spectrum CBD oil contains non-psychoactive trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like CBD, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including muscle relaxation, sleep support, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC product line is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at less than 0.3% in dry weight hemp, we’ve revisited our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we’ve increased the amount of delta-9 THC in it, so that it’s much closer to the legal THC limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — such as our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant in the US, but it also allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, that even though the THC in our vape pens is derived from hemp and within legal limits, delta-9 THC can cause psychoactive effects if you take enough of it. So, please don’t drive or operate heavy machinery if you use our THC vape products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vapes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Delta-9 OG Kush Disposable Vape Pens offer powerful relaxation benefits. Capturing the heavy calm of the legendary cannabis strain OG Kush, these delta-9 THC vape pens give you the earthy flavor and chill of this classic indica, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. With a CBD + THC pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our OG Kush THC vape pens) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. Our goal is to give our customers the best CBD experience possible. Our OG Kush delta-9 THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while also enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with full spectrum CBD and the other healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We hope you enjoy your vape pen and wish the very best for you on your wellness journey!</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Hybrid Vape Pen </span></h2>
<p><b>CBD</b> <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interacts with the endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deliver a host of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the mind and body. This is especially true when it comes to full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant, including the </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it also has other effects. Cannabis sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie, can elevate mood and spark creativity. Cannabis indica strains, such as Purple Punch, provide deep calming benefits to the mind and body. Hybrid strains, including the Pineapple Express strain featured in this vape pen, are the best of both worlds — ideal for elevating your mood and chilling you out!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis sativa strains are often associated with positive mood enhancement and feelings of exhilaration. A hybrid strain, such as Pineapple Express, gives you this and more!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis indica strains are valued for their relaxation properties — and cannabis hybrids can deliver this, as well. Plus, you get all the calming effects of full spectrum CBD, too!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in many crucial systems and organs. Delta-9 THC also delivers several wellness benefits, including antioxidant and immune benefits, stress and pain relief, sleep support, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil is the oil that’s extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant.

There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 such cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-psychoactive, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 (or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. Delta-9 THC is one of two major cannabinoids in cannabis, the other being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 shouldn’t be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which have somewhat different properties than delta-9 and are considered minor cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take delta-9 THC in large enough quantities, it can get you high. But delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Disposable Vape Pen: Pineapple Express Hybrid is derived from cannabis hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to all legal thresholds for THC and CBD products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many scientists classify all cannabis as sativa, including indica and ruderalis. Traditionally, cannabis users have separated cannabis types on the basis of their leaf shape and the effects the plant delivers when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation, creativity, and anxiety reduction. Indica is most known for its deep relaxation properties. Hybrid strains are formed when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also cannabis ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part it’s sativa and indica we’re talking about). Hybrids can deliver the best of both types of cannabis, which is why a cannabis hybrid, like Pineapple Express, is so popular with cannabis enthusiasts.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a CBD or THC Vape Pen?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaping CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the quickest way to experience its effects. The same applies to delta-9 THC vape products. With vapes, CBD, THC and other cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs, which happens much faster than if you were to enjoy CBD edibles, like cookies or gummies, or even a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you vape CBD or THC, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</span></p>

Combining the mood-lifting spirit of a sativa with the relaxation of an indica, these hybrid THC vape pens give you the perfect THC vape experience, but within the legal boundaries of the 2018 Farm Bill. With a disposable pen vape, you can feel these delta 9 effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition to all of this, you also get the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid</h2>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system</a> to deliver a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>. This is particularly true when it comes to full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant, including the <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it also has other properties. Sativa strains, like Maui Wowie, can elevate mood and spark creativity. Indica strains, like Purple Punch, provide deep calming benefits to the mind and body. Hybrid strains, like the Wedding Cake strain featured in this vape pen, are the best of both worlds — perfect for elevating your mood and chilling you out!</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis sativa strains are often associated with feelings of exhilaration and positive mood enhancement. A hybrid strain, like Wedding Cake, gives you this and more!</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Cannabis indica strains are prized for their relaxing effects — and cannabis hybrids can deliver this, as well. Plus, you get all the calming properties of full spectrum CBD to boot!</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD works with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in many crucial systems and organs. THC also delivers several wellness benefits, including antioxidant and immune benefits, sleep support, stress and pain relief, and more.</p>

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum oil is the CBD oil that’s extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids found in the hemp plant. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 such cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and non-psychoactive, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 (a.k.a. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>) is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. Delta-9 THC is one of two major cannabinoids, the other being CBD (cannabidiol). Delta-9 THC shouldn’t be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which have somewhat different properties than delta-9 and are considered minor cannabinoids. If you take delta-9 in large enough quantities, this form of THC can get you high. But THC delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The THC delta-9 we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Disposable Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to all legal thresholds for THC and CBD products.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</h2>
<p>Many scientists classify all cannabis types as sativa, including indica and ruderalis. Traditionally, cannabis users have classified cannabis types on the basis of their leaf shape and the effects the plant delivers when consumed. In general, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), creativity, and anxiety reduction. Indica is most noted for its deep relaxation properties. Hybrid strains are formed when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part it’s sativa and indica we’re talking about). Hybrid cannabis strains can deliver the best of both types of cannabis, which is why a cannabis hybrid, like Wedding Cake, is so popular with cannabis enthusiasts. Please remember that all of our products are derived from cannabis hemp (so, this is not hybrid marijuana) and have legal levels of THC (less than 0.3%).</p>
<h2>Know Your Brand: What Is the Best Delta-9 THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you buy a CBD or delta-9 product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can be assured that you’re getting a highly rated, quality CBD product. Our CBD oil is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with clean carbon dioxide. All of our CBD and THC products — including CBD + THC Delta-9 Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. And with discreet shipping, you can enjoy our THC vapes delta products with all the privacy you require.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If the Delta-9 CBD Oil in My Disposable Vape Pen Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD or THC delta-9 products, such as a disposable pen or disposable cartridge, always remember to look for an accompanying report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable and well rated CBD brand should provide independent lab test results for all of their THC flower delta 9 products. We believe in transparency and always provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab results report</a> for every CBD and THC product we sell. This means that you can really verify the potency of your CBD + Delta-9 product and be assured that it is free of harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a Delta-9 CBD Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping CBD</a> is the quickest way to experience its effects. This applies to delta-9 THC, as well. CBD, THC and other cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs, which happens much faster than if you were to enjoy CBD edibles, like cookies or gummies, or even sample a sublingual CBD tincture. When you vape CBD, THC and other cannabinoids, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance. That said, we do enjoy a good CBD cookie, too!</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the hemp we use for our highly rated <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> and delta-9 products is American-grown in the state of Kentucky. All of our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>

<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>

</ol>
<p>Once the pure CBD oil has been extracted from our organic hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>

<h2>Let Them Have Cake: Vaping Wedding Cake Delta 9 Hybrid</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Wedding Cake Disposable Vape Pens are perfect for good vibes and relaxation. Combining the uplifting spirit of a sativa with the chill of an indica, these hybrid THC vape pens give you the perfect CBD vape delta 9 experience, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a disposable pen vape, you can feel these delta 9 effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition to all of this, you also get the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Vaping With Full Spectrum CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Wedding Cake Hybrid begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned above, “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil directly extracted from the cannabis hemp plant, with all of the chemical content of the hemp plant, including trace amounts of THC. That full spectrum content includes all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD provides an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a>. This is the phenomenon wherein all of the compounds of the hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a full spectrum CBD product (such as our delta-9 pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken on its own.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens</h3>
<p>As we’ve noted before, full spectrum CBD contains non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). As with CBD, those trace amounts of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) actually have many wellness benefits, including mood elevation, sleep support, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, and more. As with other cannabinoids (such as CBG and CBN), THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 THC can have psychoactive effects if you take a large enough dosage, but THC delta-9 can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our THC line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the legal threshold of THC content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we go into our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we add the more delta-9 THC so that the resulting oil is much closer to the legal limit. The bolstered delta-9 THC product — such as our highly rated CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant, but it allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vape Products</h2>
<p>Each of our THC oil products (including our delta-9 vape pens) is formulated with your wellness and enjoyment in mind. Our goal at CBDfx is to give you the best CBD experience possible. Our full spectrum THC vape pens can give you the wellness and relaxation benefits of delta-9, and add the wellness benefits associated with CBD and the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We wish you the very best on your wellness journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBD: Maui Wowie Sativa</h2>
<p><b>CBD</b> has a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>, due to its <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interaction with the body’s endocannabinoid system</a>. This is particularly true of full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can elevate mood — particularly with sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie. CBD and THC also have natural calming properties that make a product, like our CBD + Delta-9 Sativa Pen, great for chilling out and enjoying the day!</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis sativa strains are largely associated with feelings of exhilaration and positive mood enhancement. These peaceful, uplifting effects are the perfect complement to CBD’s gentle calming properties.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil can have a peaceful calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has a restful quality to it, making this combination perfect for a relaxed “chill” session.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD works with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> to help the body maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>

The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Maui Wowie Sativa is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to all THC thresholds established by law in the US.</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa, including indica and ruderalis. Traditionally, cannabis users have separated cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects the plant generates when consumed. In general, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), creativity, and anxiety reduction. Our Maui Wowie Sativa vape is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by law.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting quality CBD. Our CBD oil is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted by means of clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My CBD + THC Vape Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD or delta-9 THC products, always look for a detailed report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent laboratory reports for all of their CBD products. We at CBDfx believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 THC product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD + Delta-9 THC oil and be assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a CBD Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping CBD</a> is the fastest way to experience its effects (THC, too!). This is because the CBD and THC are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, which happens much quicker than if you were to enjoy a CBD edible or even a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you vape CBD and THC, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBD: Maui Wowie Sativa Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the hemp we use for our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> products is grown in the United States, in the traditional hemp-growing state of Kentucky. All of our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown cannabis hemp is pesticide-free and contains no GMOs. You can be assured that your CBDfx CBD product is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals often found in products from less reputable CBD brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized extraction process that utilizes carbon dioxide to remove the CBD oil from the hemp plant. This leaves behind no potentially harmful solvents, as can happen with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the pure, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our cannabis hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and delta-9 THC products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. The results of these lab tests are made available on the front page of our website and via a QR code on every product label.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Maui Wowie Sativa is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown cannabis hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>.

<h2>The Magic Strain: Vaping Maui Wowie Sativa</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Maui Wowie Disposable Vape Pens are perfect for kicking back and chilling out. Capturing the feel-good vibes of the legendary cannabis strain Maui Wowie, these THC vape pens give you the flavor and mood elevation of this classic sativa, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the finest of all cannabis flavor profiles. In addition to all of this, you can also experience the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Vaping With Full Spectrum CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Maui Wowie Sativa begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of hemp THC or other materials filtered out. As a result, full spectrum CBD oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD delivers users an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a>. This is the term used to describe the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, and the rest of the cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our delta-9 pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken on its own.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like CBD itself, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 THC can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the legal threshold of THC content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we have increased the amount of delta-9 THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — including our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant, but it allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vape Products</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our delta-9 vape pens) is formulated with your wellness and enjoyment in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible. Our full spectrum THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with CBD and the healthful compounds of the hemp plant. We wish you the very best on your wellness journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta-9 THC Vape Pen + CBN: Purple Punch Indica</h2>
<p>Due to its <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">interaction with the endocannabinoid system</a><b>, CBD</b> has a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> for the mind and body. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD oil, which contains all of the hemp plant’s <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. THC not only brings wellness benefits through its own interaction with the endocannabinoid system, but it also can be a wonderful natural relaxant — particularly with indica strains, such as Purple Punch. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a> (cannabinol) also has deep calming effects for users, which is why it’s often referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have a gentle calming effect on the mind and body. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, particularly in indica strains, has restful quality to it, as well — as does the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid, CBN!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, like Purple Punch, have long been used to help with sleep. Combining Purple Punch delta-9 THC with full spectrum CBD and added CBN makes for a blissful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> to help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, sleep support, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the CBD oil that is extracted directly from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD oil contains all of hemp’s healthful chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD (naturally), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 THC is the THC cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Tetrahydrocannabinol</a> is one of two major cannabinoids, the other one being CBD. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. If you take delta-9 in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC threshold established by law in the US.</p>
<h2>What Is CBN?</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, or CBN, is one of the most notable of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning it is formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the psychoactive properties of THC, it does carry over the deep relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) to such an extent that CBN is referred to as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>There is some disagreement in the scientific community about how to distinguish the different types of cannabis. Some scientists classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others consider them as three distinct species. Whatever the case, cannabis users have traditionally separated cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer (for example, sativa strains add an uplifting feeling for the user). In general, the effects of indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits. Our Purple Punch cannabis CBN vape is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by US law.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil You Can Buy?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">CBDfx product</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting highly rated, quality CBD. Every ml of our CBD oil is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and extracted with pure carbon dioxide. All of our CBD products — including Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If the Oil in My CBN + THC Vape Pen Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN or THC delta products, always look for a detailed report conducted by a third-party lab. Every reputable CBD or THC delta brand will provide independent laboratory reports for all of their CBD and delta cannabis products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency for our customers and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta cannabis product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + Delta-9 THC oil and be assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the CBD or THC Effects of a Vape Pen?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">Vaping THC or CBD</a> is the fastest way to experience the effects of the cannabinoids. This is due to the fact that the CBD and THC are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to eat, say, a CBD cookie or use a sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you use a CBD or THC vape product, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes (or sooner), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in a CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica Come From?</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, all of the cannabis we use for our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> hemp products is grown in the United States, in the state of Kentucky. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>

<h2>Vaping Delta-9 Via the Purple Punch Indica Strain</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 Purple Punch Disposable Vape Pens have deep and powerful relaxation benefits. Capturing the heavy calm of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, these THC vape pens give you the earthy flavor and chill of this classic indica, but within the legal boundaries set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. With a CBD THC pen vape, you can feel these effects almost immediately — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles. In addition to all of this, you can also benefit from the wellness properties of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<h2>Using Full Spectrum CBD Oil in Vape Products</h2>
<p>The robust ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Pen: Purple Punch Indica begins with full spectrum CBD oil. As mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD oil” refers to CBD as it is directly extracted from the hemp plant, with neither the trace amounts of delta 9 THC or other materials filtered out. And so, full spectrum CBD contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant — including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC — plus, a powerful profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>Full spectrum CBD delivers an experience known as the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> for the user. Entourage Effect is the term for the phenomenon by which all of the compounds of the cannabis hemp plant — the cannabinoids, the terpenes and the flavonoids — don’t just work in parallel with one another as they interact with the endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, THC, CBN, and the other cannabis compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a product containing full spectrum CBD oil (such as our THC delta pens), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if you had taken it on its own.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum Delta-9 Pens and the Role of THC</h3>
<p>As discussed, full spectrum CBD contains non-psychoactive trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). Like cannabidiol itself, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including muscle relaxation, sleep support, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. As with other cannabinoids (like CBN), THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. It’s still important to remember that delta-9 can have psychoactive properties if you take a large enough dosage, but delta-9 THC can also provide you with several wellness benefits.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 THC product line is to maximize the wellness potential of delta-9 THC. With the legal threshold of tetrahydrocannabinol content in the US set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve revisited our CBD oil extract after the THC has been measured, and we’ve increased the amount of delta-9 so that it’s much closer to the legal THC limit. The resulting delta-9 THC product — such as our CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Pens — is still legally compliant in the US, but it also allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + THC Vapes</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 THC products (including our THC vape pens) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. Our goal is to give our customers the best CBD experience possible. Our delta-9 THC vape pens can help you relax and unwind, while also enjoying all the wellness benefits associated with full spectrum CBD and the healthful compounds of the cannabis hemp plant. We wish the very best for you on your wellness journey!</p>
