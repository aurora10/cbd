										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">A Muscle Balm Stick With CBD!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Balms are oil-based topical products, formulated to bring soothing relief to a localized area of skin and the tissue beneath. </span><b>CBD balm sticks</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> deliver all the calming benefits of </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a convenient, mess-free balm stick. These grab-and-go </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><span style="font-weight: 400">topical CBD products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are a must-have for every gym bag, training table, backpack, handbag, and medicine cabinet. Our CBD balms feature organic, non-GMO CBD in 750 mg CBD and 3000 mg CBD strengths, plus skin-soothing hemp seed oil, active botanical oils, and other effective ingredients. This potent </span><b>CBD balm</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is also cruelty-free and vegan.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How Our CBD Balm Works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To understand the </span><b>benefits of CBD balm</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> products, it’s important to understand their main ingredient: </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabidiol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (CBD). CBD is one of a group of compounds found in the cannabis plant, called cannabinoids. There are over 100 different cannabinoids found in cannabis, and CBD is one of the two most prevalent (along with THC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When CBD and other phytocannabinoids (plant-based cannabinoids) are consumed, they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system, mimicking the behavior of the body’s own endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids interact with systems and organs throughout the body, helping them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This interaction helps your body regulate a wide range of important functions, including pain, inflammation, stress, sleep, mood, memory, appetite, motor control, and much more. When CBD and other cannabinoids interact with receptors in the endocannabinoid system, they bolster the body’s ability to regulate these functions, resulting in a bevy of wellness benefits.</span></p>
<p><b>Topical CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> products are particularly effective in their interaction with CB2 receptors, which balance pain and inflammation. These benefits make CBD balm, CBD cream, and CBD lotion products so popular.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Is CBD Balm Used For?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD Balm Stick for Muscle and Joint is the perfect recovery product, whether you’re a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/take-a-hike/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hiker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-runners-benefit-from-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">runner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-weightlifters/"><span style="font-weight: 400">weightlifter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-use-cbd-to-achieve-your-fitness-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400">gym rat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or simply a person who needs soothing relief for aches and pains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This potent balm product combines organic broad spectrum CBD and skin-nourishing hemp seed oil with muscle-warming camphor oil, peppermint and wintergreen oils for pain relief and wonderful aromatherapeutic benefits, skin-pampering shea butter, nutrient-rich camphor oil for even more pain relief and anti-inflammatory benefits, black pepper oil for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and menthol for cooling deep-tissue comfort. Our Muscle and Joint CBD Balm is a must-have topical product for any </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-top-5-products-for-an-active-lifestyle/"><span style="font-weight: 400">active lifestyle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or for the aches and pains that come with aging or recovery.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We also carry a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD Balm Stick for Calming and Moisturizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for inflamed and irritated skin. This balm soothes your skin, nourishing and protecting it against future irritations, with skin-nourishing hemp seed oil, moisturizing shea butter and Roman chamomile oil, and other active botanicals, including lavender, chamomile, and tea tree oils. This CBD balm is a wonderful CBD skincare product to have on-hand in your medicine cabinet at all times.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How to Use CBD Balm</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using a CBD balm is easy. Just rub the CBD balm stick on the affected area and let the CBD and other ingredients work their magic. Make sure to use enough balm to cover the entire affected area, and allow the CBD to sink in for an hour. If you don’t feel any relief by that point, simply reapply as needed. It’s highly unlikely that you can take too much CBD through a topical CBD product, but we recommend no more than three or four applications per day.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why Buy CBD Balm From CBDfx?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At CBDfx, we’re dedicated to providing you with the highest-quality CBD products anywhere. All of our products are made with CBD oil derived from organic hemp plants. We also use clean carbon dioxide to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/"><span style="font-weight: 400">extract the CBD oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the plant, which ensures that you won’t find any potentially toxic solvent residues in your CBD product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can verify the purity and potency of your CBD balm (or any CBD product we sell), by looking at the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/lab-reports/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Certificate of Analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (COA). Certificates of Analysis are CBD lab reports generated by an independent, third-party laboratory, which will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any harmful compounds.

					<description><![CDATA[Our Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm provides soothing relief for your dog or cat’s dry or inflamed skin, nose and paws. With 750mg of calming and wellness-enriching CBD, plus the multifaceted benefits of odorless Alaskan salmon oil and moisturizing shea butter, and a variety of gently comforting essential oils — lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile — it’s the perfect Pet CBD Balm.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm</h2>
<p>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm is a must for pet owners, who understand that their dog or cat deals with a variety of potentially serious skin issues, particularly on the nose and paws. This pet CBD balm protects and moisturizes the skin with all-natural ingredients, including organic broad spectrum CBD, harvested and processed right here in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Not only does this CBD balm for pets feature hemp-extracted CBD, but it also boasts additional hemp seed oil, which contains three healthy, polyunsaturated fatty acids: linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid. These fatty acids strengthen the skin, assist it in combating infection, and have multiple anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Our CBD pet balm features other key ingredients as well, which further enhance its effects. Odorless Alaskan salmon oil contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties, promote a healthy skin and coat, and have other wellness benefits. Shea butter moisturizes dry skin, reduces inflammation, and provides soothing relief to itchy and peeling skin. Candelilla wax hydrates and smoothes parched, scaly skin. And on top of all that, we’ve added a blend of lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile essential oils to nurture your dog or cat’s skin even further. Taken together, these ingredients provide welcome relief for pets suffering from skin issues.</p>
<h3>Why Does My Dog Need CBD Balm?</h3>
<p>It would be nice if our dog or cat could tell us when they’re irritated or hurting. Dog paws can be particularly sensitive. They harden and dry out for a variety of reasons, from aging to surface wear. When this happens, the paw pad skin can crack, which can easily lead to inflammation, infection, and general discomfort. Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm not only soothes the pain that accompanies this cracked skin, but also moisturizes, smoothes and protects the skin so that it can heal.</p>
<p>Dog noses are also prone to drying out, particularly in hot sun or cold weather — much like our human lips chap if we don’t protect them with lip balm. Given that dogs’ most powerful sense is smell, that sniffer gets an intense workout nearly every waking moment. So, keeping their nose hydrated and protected is a must.</p>
<p>Our CBD balm for pets can be used on any area of the skin that is reddened, irritated or inflamed. Just make sure to keep it away from your pupper’s eyes.</p>
<h3>Can I Use CBD Balm on My Cat?</h3>
<p>Because cats are so much smaller than the average dog, we sometimes forget that they can have similar health issues. As with dogs, a cat’s skin, paws and nose can dry out, and get irritated, inflamed or infected. So, it’s a good idea for cat owners to also keep CBD Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm on hand, so that their kitties’ pouncing peds and boopy noses remain hydrated and healthy.</p>
<h3>IS CBD Safe for Pets?</h3>
<p>Like humans and other mammals, dogs and cats have an endocannabinoid system, which regulates and balances sleep, immune response, communication between cells, appetite and metabolism, memory, and other vital processes. Their bodies, in fact, produce their own cannabinoids. The cannabinoids found in the hemp plant, known as phytocannabinoids, have been found to support and bolster this system, leading to a variety of wellness benefits.</p>
<p>And no, CBD won’t get your pet — or you — “high.” THC is the cannabinoid that provides the intoxicating effects everyone associates with marijuana. Because CBD is processed from the hemp plant, rather than from marijuana, it is nearly THC free — with legal amounts in CBD products at the nearly undetectable level of less than 0.3%. So, your dog or cat is not only safe in using this natural topical, but also they won’t be stumbling around your house because of it.</p>
<h3>How Does Alaskan Salmon Oil Help My Pet?</h3>
<p>Salmon oil is an incredibly nutrient-rich supplement. For years, humans have taken fish oil to support everything from heart health to immune function. This stems from two fatty acids that are readily available in the oil: omega-3 and omega-6 acids. For the skin, these fatty acids serve as an effective anti-inflammatory, as well as make the skin appear shiny and vibrant. The omega-3 acid known as eicosapentaenoic acid, in particular, produces arachidonic acid, which restricts the growth of pro-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p>Oh, and we agree that salmon can be pretty darned stinky around the house. That’s why our Alaskan salmon oil is processed to be completely odor-free, so you won’t have to worry about your pet offending.</p>
<h3>Your BFF Deserves Quality &amp; Purity</h3>
<p>At CBDfx, all of our hemp is grown right here in the U.S.A., in the richly soiled hills of Kentucky. We choose only the best hemp plants for our CBD oil production: 100% organic and lab-tested by a third-party for exceptional quality and transparency. All of our CBD products are made to exacting standards, containing only natural ingredients to give you and your pet the most effective experience possible.</p>
