										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Maui Wowie Sativa </span></h2>
<p><b>Delta-9 THC Maui Wowie Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is perfect for kicking back and getting the most enjoyment out of your day. Evoking the pleasurable vibes of the legendary sativa Maui Wowie, this </span><b>delta-9 vape juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the flavor and mood elevation of a classic cannabis strain, but within the legal THC limits set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. With a vape product, you can feel these effects within minutes (sometimes seconds) — plus, enjoy one of the most popular of all cannabis flavor profiles. On top of all that, you can experience the calming wellness effects of robust full spectrum CBD!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) is known for its many </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the mind and body, thanks to its </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interaction with the endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the healthful compounds of cannabis hemp, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) not only contributes to the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, but it can also lend positive mood enhancement and feelings of exhilaration — particularly with sativa strains, such as Maui Wowie. CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a> also have natural calming properties that make a product, like our CBD + Delta-9 Sativa Vape Juice, great for uplifting your mood and even providing bursts of creativity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the oil that is directly extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant. This robust CBD oil contains all of hemp’s healthful chemical compounds, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. This includes </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and non-intoxicating, trace amounts of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%, by law).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp can contain up to 0.3% THC, full spectrum hemp extract can sometimes produce quite a bit less THC than that. Understanding that many customers want to enjoy the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products, where we add extra delta-9 THC back into the full spectrum CBD oil to give you maximum legal THC enjoyment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant, the other being CBD. Delta-9 THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) should not be confused with delta-8 and delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different properties than delta-9. Delta-9 THC does have psychoactive properties and if you take this compound in large enough quantities, it can get you high. But delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, as well, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, mood elevation, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we use in our CBD + Delta-9 </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is derived from hemp (not marijuana) and adheres to the THC limits set forth in the 2018 US Farm Bill.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa, including ruderalis and indica. Cannabis users have traditionally separated types of cannabis based on leaf shape and the effects it generates when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of sativa can be observed as mood elevation, creativity, and a reduction in stress and anxiety. Our Maui Wowie Sativa Vape Juice is formulated to deliver these effects, but within the THC limits established by US law. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of Vaping CBD &amp; THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><b>Vaping THC</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CBD is the fastest way to experience their effects. This is because the cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the lungs, which happens much quicker than if you were to take a CBD edible or sublingual CBD tincture oil. When you </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-vaping-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vape THC and CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can potentially feel the effects in just a few minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, CBD and THC tolerance, and metabolism.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is CBDfx THC Vape Juice the Best THC e-Liquid You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of our products are formulated with your safety and satisfaction in mind.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of CBN + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Purple Punch Indica </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><b>CBN + Delta-9 THC Purple Punch Indica Vape Juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers powerful relaxation benefits for the mind and body. Capturing the deep calming effects of the legendary cannabis strain Purple Punch, this </span><b>THC vape juice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the lip-smacking flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD and the potent cannabinoid, CBN, takes those effects to the next level. And with a </span><b>THC vape</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product, you can feel these blissful benefits almost immediately!</span></p>
<p><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) has become incredibly popular because of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it delivers for the body and mind. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the ECS, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This interaction is especially powerful with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp compounds, including all </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. One of those cannabinoids, </span><b>CBN </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(cannabinol), has especially powerful sleep effects, which is why it’s commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” </span><b>Delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes heartily to both the wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these three cannabinoids make a powerful combination to help you get the rest and joyous relaxation you desire.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD oil is the initial extract pulled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This potent oil contains all of the health-boosting chemical compounds of hemp, including all </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and healthy fatty acids. Cannabis contains </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 different cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the aforementioned CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and small, non-intoxicating amounts of delta-9 </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp can contain up to 0.3% THC under US law, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal limit. We know that many customers seek the full legal benefits of THC, and so we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products with them in mind. With our </span><b>THC vape oil</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other delta-9 products, we’ve added bonus delta-9 THC to the full spectrum CBD to give you maximum legal THC effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBN?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is among the most well known of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. Cannabinol is a metabolite of delta-9 THC, meaning that it’s formed when the composition of THC has been altered by heat or light. While it does not retain the psychoactive properties of delta-9 THC, CBN does carry over the deep relaxation effects of delta-9 THC to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant (along with CBD). This cannabinoid should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than tetrahydrocannabinol. Delta-9 THC does produce psychoactive effects, and if you take this compound in large enough quantities, it can definitely get you high. But delta-9 THC also produces several wellness benefits, including sleep support, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, stress and pain management, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we use in our CBD + </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is all derived from hemp and is compliant under the 2018 US Farm Bill. This vape juice is not a marijuana product.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Indica?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some in the scientific community classify all cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa, while others disagree and consider them to be three distinct species. Cannabis users, though, have traditionally separated these three cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. Generally speaking, the effects of cannabis indica can be observed as relaxation of the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBN + THC Purple Punch Vape Juice is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established by the US 2018 Farm Bill. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is CBDfx Delta-9 THC Vape Juice the Best You Can Buy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product is formulated with your safety and satisfaction in mind.

This includes </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and small, non-intoxicating amounts of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemp, by law, can contain up to 0.3% THC, full spectrum CBD oil can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limits. Understanding that many customers seek the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products. With our Delta-9 THC products, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to the full spectrum CBD extract to give you maximum legal THC effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is one of two major cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9 THC. Delta-9 does have psychoactive effects and if you take it in large enough quantities, tetrahydrocannabinol can get you high. But delta-9 also has many wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we use in our CBD + </span><b>THC Vape Juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not derived from marijuana, but is instead derived from hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 US Farm Bill.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a Cannabis Hybrid?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, cannabis users have classified the different types of cannabis on the basis of the plant’s leaf shape and the effects it delivers when consumed. Generally speaking, the effects of a cannabis sativa are considered to include mood elevation, creativity, and stress/anxiety reduction. Cannabis indica is most known for its deep relaxation effects. Hybrid strains are created when growers combine a sativa with an indica (there are also cannabis ruderalis hybrids, but for the most part, hybrids refer to a combination of sativa and indica). Hybrid strains can deliver the most pleasing effects of both cannabis types, which is why hybrids, like Wedding Cake, are so popular with cannabis enthusiasts.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><b>Vaping THC</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CBD and other cannabinoids is the quickest way to experience their effects. This is due to the cannabinoids being absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of the lungs, which occurs much quicker than if you were to take an edible CBD product or sublingual CBD oil.

					<description><![CDATA[Our Pineapple Express Hybrid Vape Juice is formulated to give you the uplifting vibes of a good sativa combined with the deep relaxation of an indica — all within the legal limits for delta-9 THC! Along with the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD, it’s the perfect vape juice for a long, chill afternoon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Pineapple Express &#8211; Hybrid</h2>
<p><strong>Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Vape Juice</strong> is an ideal blend of good vibes and gentle relaxation. Combining the mood elevation of a sativa with the deep chill feel of an indica, this hybrid <strong>THC vape liquid</strong> gives you a wonderfully balanced delta-9 THC vape experience, within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. When you vape with this potent <strong>THC e-liquid</strong>, you can feel the effects of the cannabinoids almost immediately and enjoy one of the most popular (and famous!) cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition, you also get all the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> (or cannabidiol) is renowned for the many <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> it delivers to the body and mind as a result of its interaction with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which is the term used for the initial extract culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of cannabis hemp, containing all of hemp’s <strong>cannabinoids</strong> (including CBD and THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids.</p>
<p>Like CBD, <strong>THC</strong> (or tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes positively to the wellness benefits associated with the ECS, plus it can also add mood enhancement and relaxation. It’s this combination of blissful benefits that’s particularly notable in cannabis hybrid strains, such as the famous Pineapple Express.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of the hemp plant. This robust oil contains all of the hemp plant’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in hemp, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small, non-intoxicating levels of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limit, however. Understanding that many customers seek the maximum legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection of products. With our Delta-9 THC line, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to full spectrum CBD to give you maximum THC effects allowed by law.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our OG Kush Indica Vape Juice is designed to give you all the relaxing properties of a good cannabis indica, but with legally compliant levels of delta-9 THC. The restful THC properties of this delicious vape e-liquid are delightfully complemented with the calming wellness effects of full spectrum CBD, evoking relaxed memories of this classic cannabis strain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: OG Kush Indica</h2>
<p>Our <strong>CBD + Delta-9 THC OG Kush Indica Vape Juice</strong> delivers powerful relaxation effects for the mind and body. Capturing the deeply calming aspects of the legendary cannabis strain OG Kush, this <strong>THC e-liquid</strong> gives you the distinct flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal THC limits set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD takes those effects to the next level. And with a <strong>THC vape juice</strong> product, you can feel these benefits almost immediately!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of CBD</a> (cannabidiol) for the body and mind have made it an incredibly popular wellness supplement. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially notable with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp’s health-boosting compounds, including all <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/"><strong>Delta-9 THC</strong></a> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes greatly to both the health and wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also delivers deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these cannabinoids make a potent combination to help you get the rest and sweet “chill” you desire.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the initial oil extract culled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This robust CBD oil contains all of the wellness-boosting chemical compounds of cannabis hemp, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. Hemp contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a>, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and non-intoxicating trace amounts of delta-9 <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%).</p>
<p>While hemp can legally contain up to 0.3% THC in the US, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal threshold. Knowing that many people seek the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products. With these delta-9 products (including our OG Kush <strong>THC vape oil</strong>), we’ve added bonus THC to the full spectrum CBD oil to give you maximum legal delta-9 THC effects.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* is one of two major cannabinoids (the other being CBD) produced by the cannabis plant. This cannabinoid is different from delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9. Delta-9 THC does produce psychotropic effects, and if you take it in large enough quantities, tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high.</p>
<p>But delta-9 THC also produces several health and wellness benefits, including mood elevation, sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta-9 THC</a>* we use in our <strong>THC vape juices</strong> is derived from hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill. This <strong>THC e liquid</strong> is not a marijuana product.</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>Some folks in the scientific community classify all forms of cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa. Others disagree and consider sativa, ruderalis, and indica to be three distinct species. Cannabis enthusiasts, though, have traditionally separated these cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects they generate when consumed. Generally speaking, cannabis indica produces relaxation benefits for the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBD + THC OG Kush Vape Juice is formulated to deliver these benefits, while still legally compliant with the US 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx Delta-9 THC Vape Juice the Best You Can Buy?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Juice 500 &#8211; 2000mg</h2>
<p>It feels good to puff away your problems with a tasty de-stressor. Thankfully, that’s exactly what our Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Juice was designed to do. With a desire to combine effective, pure 99% CBD isolate with a delicious flavor to keep you coming back for more, our latest CBD vape juices are perfect for tasty relief from daily stress and anxiety.</p>
<ul>
<li data-marked="true">99% Pure CBD Isolate (500mg-2000mg)</li>
<li data-marked="true">Expertly-Crafted Flavor for Maximum Enjoyment</li>
<li data-marked="true">High-Quality Food-Grade Ingredients</li>
<li data-marked="true">50/50 VG &amp; PG Ratio</li>
<li data-marked="true">ND-THC***</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-marked="true">Meet Our Blue Raspberry Vape Juice (500mg-2000mg)</h2>
<p data-marked="true">Our Blue Raspberry CBD Vape Juice is tart, sweet, and reminiscent of your favorite candy flavors growing up. And fortunately, it won’t turn your tongue blue! Our flavored CBD vape juice has the essence of everything you love about the classic Blue Raspberry flavor and makes your daily serving of CBD both a fun and tasty treat.</p>
<h3 data-marked="true">So, How Does Vaping Affect the Body?</h3>
<p data-marked="true">Vaping CBD is a lot more effective than people realize.</p>
<p data-marked="true">Fast absorption is what really places this method of CBD consumption ahead of others. When you vape CBD, you absorb the compound at a much faster rate than other methods. This allows it to reach your bloodstream through your lungs instead of your digestive system—which is what helps you feel the effects on your brain&#8217;s receptors even faster.</p>
<p data-marked="true">Not only does it absorb faster, but it’s also common to see CBD vape juice with very few ingredients. This makes it perfect for those who prefer to consume CBD with minimal additives.</p>
<p data-marked="true">CBD vaping also allows you to personalize your CBD serving by vaping more or less on a given day. The choice is totally up to your discretion and how much you want to feel the relaxing effects of CBD at that moment.</p>
<p data-marked="true">Another critical benefit to CBD vaping is this…</p>
<p data-marked="true">It wears off within a reasonable timeframe—in many cases 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p data-marked="true">What this beneficial timetable allows is for you to feel the effects of CBD with a MUCH greater level of control, allowing the feeling to fade when you need to be more alert.</p>
<p data-marked="true">Today, vaping CBD is also one of the most relaxed forms of consumption due to the delicious flavor-filled clouds and long-lasting tastes. The pure act of vaping is undeniably satisfying, and just think: we haven’t even gotten started on the flavors of our CBDfx vape juice!</p>
<h3 data-marked="true">The Benefits of Vaping CBD</h3>
<h4 data-marked="true">Fast-Acting Benefits</h4>
<p data-marked="true">Due to the speed at which CBD enters your bloodstream through the lungs, CBD vaping remains one of the fastest methods of experiencing the benefits of CBD.</p>
<h4 data-marked="true">Greater Control</h4>
<p data-marked="true">As the benefits of CBD derived from vaping wear off quickly, vaping CBD can give you much greater control over when you wish to feel your CBD (taking a puff) and when you don’t.</p>
<h4 data-marked="true">Incredible Flavor</h4>
<p data-marked="true">Take a few drops from a tincture of raw CBD and you’ll see that taste isn’t always the strong suit of consuming CBD. However, with CBD vaping, you have your choice of a variety of delicious juices to make intaking your daily CBD an enjoyable experience.</p>
<h2 data-marked="true">Here’s What to Do Next…</h2>
<p data-marked="true">Grab a tasty vape juice and take a puff!</p>
<p data-marked="true">We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, vaping combines the taste of your favorite candies and foods with the fast-acting benefits of CBD.</p>
<p data-marked="true">In this way, it’s difficult to resist the charms of a good vape juice. Add in the fact that you have more control over the length of your CBD benefits’ effects and you’ve got an incredible recipe for quick AND long-lasting wellness.</p>
<p>Now, go forth and vape!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fresh Mint CBD Vape Juice 500 &#8211; 2000mg</h2>
<p>Whether you’re getting ready for a big date or a big meeting, when your nerves are tight and your breath isn’t as fresh as you’d like, you can count on our Fresh Mint Vape Juice to handle the rest. Utilizing pure 99% CBD isolate with a delicious flavor to keep you coming back for more, our latest CBD vape juices are perfect for cooling relief from daily stress and anxiety.</p>
<h3>Meet Our Fresh Mint CBD Vape Juice (500mg-2000mg)</h3>
<p>There are few things as refreshing as your first bite in a minty and flavorful gum&#8230;until now. With our Fresh Mint Vape Juice, gain the delicious, fresh-tasting breath you want, along with the chilling effects of CBD you know and love.</p>
<h3>So, How Does Vaping Affect the Body?</h3>
<p>Vaping CBD is a lot more effective than people realize.</p>
<p>Fast absorption is what really places this method of CBD consumption ahead of others. When you vape CBD, you absorb the compound at a much faster rate than other methods. This allows it to reach your bloodstream through your lungs instead of your digestive system—which is what helps you feel the effects on your brain&#8217;s receptors even faster.</p>
<p>Not only does it absorb faster, but it’s also common to see CBD vape juice with very few ingredients. This makes it perfect for those who prefer to consume CBD with minimal additives.</p>
<p>CBD vaping also allows you to personalize your CBD serving by vaping more or less on a given day. The choice is totally up to your discretion and how much you want to feel the relaxing effects of CBD at that moment.</p>
<p>Another critical benefit to CBD vaping is this…</p>
<p>It wears off in a shorter timeframe than if you ingested it—in many cases 30 minutes to an hour depending on the milligram strength of the vape liquid.</p>
<p>What this beneficial timetable allows is for you to feel the effects of CBD with a MUCH greater level of control, allowing the feeling to fade if you need to be more alert.</p>
<p>Today, vaping CBD is also one of the most relaxed forms of consumption due to the delicious flavor-filled clouds and long-lasting tastes. The pure act of vaping is undeniably satisfying, and just think: we haven’t even gotten started on the flavors of our CBDfx vape juice!</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Vaping CBD</h3>
<p><strong>Fast-Acting Benefits</strong><br />
Due to the speed at which CBD enters your bloodstream through the lungs, CBD vaping remains one of the fastest methods of experiencing the benefits of CBD.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Control</strong><br />
As the benefits of CBD derived from vaping wear off quickly, vaping CBD can give you much greater control over when you wish to feel your CBD (taking a puff) and when you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Incredible Flavor</strong><br />
Take a few drops from a tincture of raw CBD and you’ll see that taste isn’t always the strong suit of consuming CBD. However, with CBD vaping, you have your choice of a variety of delicious juices to make intaking your daily CBD an enjoyable experience.</p>
<h3>Here’s What to Do Next…</h3>
<p>Grab a tasty vape juice and take a puff!</p>
<p>We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, vaping combines the taste of your favorite flavors and foods with the fast-acting benefits of CBD.</p>
<p>In this way, it’s difficult to resist the charms of a good vape juice. Add in the fact that you have more control over the length of your CBD benefits’ effects and you’ve got an incredible recipe for quick AND long-lasting wellness.</p>
<p>Now, go forth and vape!</p>
