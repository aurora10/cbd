										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC Pills: Daily Chill Cannabis Blend + CBD</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Daily Microdose Delta-9 </span><b>THC Pills</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow you to dial back your stress and simply relax. With the added boost of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/"><b>delta-9 THC</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these </span><b>full spectrum CBD capsules</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver total body relaxation with a deep sense of peace.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of THC Pills and Capsules</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD wellness benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with its positive effects on the body’s endocannabinoid system, </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also has powerful calming properties — particularly in </span><b>full spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil, which contains all of the </span><b>cannabinoids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (tetrahydrocannabinol) also delivers a host of wellness benefits, plus enhanced mood and relaxation. Together, these two cannabinoids make a powerful combination for those looking to “chill” the natural way. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among CBD’s many benefits is a wonderful calming effect that brings relaxation to the mind and body. This is partially due to the presence of CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” in full spectrum and broad spectrum CBD oil. Tetrahydrocannabinol raises the relaxation factor with additional calming effects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress Relief</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the relaxation benefits of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil (plus THC!), these pills are great for easing nervous tension and stress, which can lead to anxiety. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Enhancement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most pronounced effects of delta-9 is mood elevation. Lift your spirits and enjoy a state of peaceful bliss with our Daily Microdose Pills.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD interacts with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol has several wellness benefits, too, including pain and stress relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-Lasting Effects</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t forget that pills are edibles, which means the cannabinoids stay in your system much longer than other methods of consumption, such as vaping or sublingual tinctures. While it can take 30 minutes to two hours for the effects of edibles to fully kick in (depending on bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, and tolerance), those effects can last as long as six to eight hours!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the CBD oil that is directly extracted from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust cannabis oil contains all of the chemical compounds of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabis hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, including </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In addition to CBD (cannabidiol), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other notable </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, full spectrum oil also contains trace amounts of THC (by law, less than 0.3%). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are similar naming conventions for a few minor cannabinoids (see: delta-8 and delta-10 THC), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9’s full name is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, it’s true that in large enough quantities, this compound can get you high. But delta-9 also has several wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC that we use in our Daily Microdose Cannabis Blend Pills is derived from the form of cannabis called hemp and adheres to legal thresholds required under US law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our products are designed for wellness and, as mentioned, fall within the US legal limits for tetrahydrocannabinol. Still, it is important to remember that this cannabis compound can potentially cause psychotropic effects. So, please don’t drive or operate heavy machinery when using these cannabis capsules.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Entourage Effect</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, they don’t merely work in parallel with one another. Instead, these cannabis cousins actually bolster each other’s effects. We call this phenomenon the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s a major reason why many CBD users prefer the healthful and robust cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like CBD, tetrahydrocannabinol is a major cannabinoid and, yes, it can absolutely contribute to the CBD Entourage Effect when they are taken together. The opposite is true, as well: CBD can make the effects of your delta-9 more pronounced, too!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Take THC Pills &amp; Microdosing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking delta-9 pills is simple. Just swallow your one-pill serving. This provides 25mg of full spectrum CBD and 2.5mg of time-release THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-guide-to-microdosing-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microdose THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’re not taking enough to feel the more pronounced effects of the compound. But with a low dosage, you can still take advantage of its many wellness benefits. With only 2.5mg of time-release THC per serving, these pills are ideal for microdosing. Still, it’s important to try these low-dose cannabis caps and get a sense of their effects before making them a part of your daily supplement regimen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted earlier, the effects of these cannabis oil capsules will take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, but should last six to eight hours — which is much longer than vaping or even tincture oil effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Are THC Pills Made?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people prefer to take delta-9 in capsule form, as for some a capsule provides easier digestion of oil. A capsule also provides a consistent dose every time. Our delta-9 caps contain only the finest ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase a product with the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> label, you can be assured that you’re getting top-quality CBD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of our CBD is grown organically in the United States, and is extracted from the cannabis hemp plant by means of clean carbon dioxide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also add natural, coconut-derived MCT oil, boosting absorption efficacy and providing you with a deeper delta-9 experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our CBD products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory, and all of those reports — called a </span><b>Certificate of Analysis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or COA — are made available to our customers on our website. You can also scan the QR code on any product label to access your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certificate of Analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you shop with CBDfx, you can rest assured that your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts on Full Spectrum CBD Capsules With Delta-9</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">  CBD + CBG Capsules For Energy &amp; Focus &#8211; 100% Vegan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great with any breakfast, our CBD + CBG Morning Capsules bring you all the energy and focus you need to get the most out of your day.</p>
<p>Using CO2-extracted, non-GMO, vegan, and 100% organic CBD + CBG oil, our Morning Capsules deliver all the benefits of CBD (improved mental and physical calm) and CBG (greater energy and alertness) to produce the “entourage effect”—an instance where combined cannabinoids work in tandem to generate more pronounced benefits in the body.</p>
<p>Our Vegan CBD + CBG Morning Capsules also come packed with a boost of energizing, slow-release caffeine for heightened physical energy without you having to make a pitstop at Starbucks.</p>
<p>For greater alertness and focus, our CBD + CBG Morning Capsules also contain the powerful amino acid L-Tyrosine—known for its ability to improve concentration in mentally-intensive tasks like work or study—as well as a host of specially-curated terpenes for better cognitive performance without the crash.</p>
<p>And finally, for an added boost to your immune system, we’ve included a dash of the powerful antioxidant, Curcumin, championed for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>All together, our Vegan CBD + CBG Morning Capsules give you everything your body needs to get up and go in the morning with a renewed sense of energy, ease of mind, and better wellbeing to seize the day.</p>
<p>Each of our CBD + CBG Morning Capsule bottles come in at 900mg (60ct, 30mg per serving) for a completely energizing CBD experience in one convenient pill.</p>
<h2>WAIT, WHAT IS CBG?</h2>
<p>If you haven’t heard of CBG, you’re not alone. While CBD has exploded in popularity within the cannabis industry, CBG remains an unfamiliar cannabinoid to most consumers.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick breakdown…</p>
<p>As a minor cannabinoid, Cannabigerol (CBG) is found in hemp. Possessing a variety of unique properties physiologically distinct from CBD, CBG interacts with certain receptors of the brain differently—ultimately, producing different effects in the body. When the effects of CBG are combined with CBD, both cannabinoids can work to produce the “entourage effect”—an instance where both cannabinoids work to strengthen the other in tandem to heighten the effects on the body.</p>
<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<p>Known for its ability to provide a sense of energizing alertness to the body, CBG—like all cannabinoids—binds to key receptors in the brain (CB1, CB2, or both) to produce physiological reactions in the body. Some of these effects are commonly found to be increased energy and a greater sense of calm by users.</p>
<h2>WHY SHOULD I TRY THE VEGAN CBD + CBG MORNING CAPSULES?</h2>
<p>They’re the perfect addition to your morning routine.</p>
<p>Tackling the day ahead is often filled with unforeseen challenges and hurdles, and to overcome them, you’ll need to make sure your physical and mental energies are at their highest potential.</p>
<p>Our CBD + CBG Morning Capsules combine a host of natural compounds and ingredients to give your body everything it needs to get up and get after it with renewed vitality.</p>
<p>For anyone wishing to get the most out of their day with a healthy punch of energy and focus, our Vegan CBD + CBG Morning Capsules are a must-have addition to include in any morning routine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"> CBD + CBN Night Capsules For Sleep &#8211;  Vegan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perfect just before bed, our CBD + CBN Night Capsules help place your mind and body at ease, preparing it for a night of restful and relaxing sleep.</p>
<p>Combining the benefits of CO2-extracted, non-GMO, vegan, and 100% organic CBD + CBN oil, our Night Capsules bring you the calming-inducing benefits of CBD and take them a step further with the “Entourage Effect” brought with the inclusion of high-potency CBN. Working in tandem, both cannabinoids work to produce a greater sense of calm both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsules also include a host of natural extracts and botanicals that serve to heighten the effects of more restful sleep. These include organic Valerian Root, GABA, Magnesium, and a specialized-blend of terpenes that serve to calm the mind and tire the body to make getting to bed easier than ever, and sleep more restful and energizing.</p>
<p>When all combined, this <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-sleep/">CBD sleep aid</a> give your body everything it needs to relax, destress, and prepare for sleep without the added side effects typically associated with prescription medication or over-the-counter sleep aids.</p>
<p>Each of our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsule for sleep bottles come in at 900mg (60ct, 30mg per serving) to bring you a more restful sleeping experience.</p>
<h2>WAIT, WHAT IS CBN?</h2>
<p>As a lesser known cannabinoid, the prominence of Cannabinol (CBN) can fly under the radar of even the most-experienced CBD users. However, as a minor cannabinoid—along with other cannabinoids such as CBD, CBG, etc.—CBN can have profound effects on the body, particularly in conjunction with other cannabinoids to produce the “Entourage Effect.”</p>
<p>A natural derivative of “aged” THC, CBN is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid known for its natural sleep-enhancing properties. In conjunction with CBD, CBN binds to the brain’s CB1 receptors to produce a calming effect, promoting easier, longer, and more restful sleep in the body.</p>
<h2>WHY SHOULD I TRY THE CBD + CBN NIGHT CAPSULES?</h2>
<p>If you ever have trouble sleeping—and most Americans do—they can be an incredible asset for getting yourself to sleep easier than ever.</p>
<p>Our days at work or at school can be long and hard, and although we might be physically and mentally exhausted by the time we’re ready for bed, sometimes our minds are still going. In these cases, getting to sleep can be difficult, and worse still, staying up can cause us to be groggy and fatigued come morning, making the day’s challenges that much harder to take on.</p>
<p>Instead of tossing and turning, waiting for yourself to get tired, it’s better to use a natural sleep aid to prepare your brain for bed when you need it most.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our Vegan CBD + CBN Night Capsules achieve just that, utilizing the natural calming effects of CBD and CBN, combined, and adding a host of other natural sleep-enhancing botanicals to make getting to sleep easier and more energizing.</p>
<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
<p>Like other cannabinoids, CBN works to bind to the brain’s key receptions (CB1, CB2, or both) to produce physiological reactions in the body. These reactions are commonly understood to produce a greater sense of calm in the mind and body, allowing more restful sleep for those ready for bed.</p>
<h3>MADE IN THE U.S.A</h3>
<p>There are only a few countries in the world producing industrial-grade hemp at the quality and scope required for effective and beneficial CBD products.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we’re proud to say that the hemp we use is grown right here in the U.S.</p>
<p>With a complete dedication to the service of our customers, our products are made exclusively from the finest-quality hemp, extraction, and testing practices in the world.</p>
<p>Our hemp crops and oils are 100% organic, non-GMO, pesticide-free, vegan, and extracted using one of the cleanest and most-efficient processing methods in the industry (CO2 extraction).</p>
<p>We also stamp each and every one of our products with a trackable QR code linking them to their individual lab report, giving you the peace of mind to know when, how, and where your products were.</p>
<p><strong>This product may cause drowsiness and/or sleepiness; do not take when driving, operating heavy machinery or engaging in any activity that requires alertness.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[People tend to think of CBD as a relaxation product because of its calming properties, but combined with the right combination of ingredients it can actually be a great focus product, due to its ability to calm the mind. This makes CBD a wonderful addition to energy products like our Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops, Morning Capsules and Focus Shots. The mushroom drops give a blast of energy through nootropic and adaptogenic cordyceps mushrooms, plus wellness-boosting chaga and lion’s mane. This tasty tincture also features the “mother of all cannabinoids,” CBG, which intensifies CBD’s focusing effect. Our Morning Capsules add time-released caffeine and other energizing ingredients to the potent CBD-CBG cannabinoid combo. And our CBD Focus Shots combine time-released caffeine with L-arginine for healthy blood flow. Each of these products is a great way to start a productive day!]]></description>
