<h2>Why Are CBDfx Mushroom Oils the Best Mushroom Tincture Oils?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">The CBDfx label represents quality and potency</a>. Our CBD is derived exclusively from hemp plants grown organically at our state-of-the-art partner farms in the USA, and extracted with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">clean CO2</a>. Our mushrooms are also organically grown, ensuring that all of our CBD mushroom oil drops are the purest and most potent tincture oils on the market.</p>
<h2>How Can I Be Sure the CBD and Mushroom Extracts in My CBD Mushroom Oil Are Pure and Organic?</h2>
<p>Every reputable CBD company gets their products tested by an independent third-party laboratory, and then makes those results available to its customers. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">At CBDfx, we provide tests for every product we sell on our website</a>, so that you can be sure that there are no contaminants in your product and so that you can verify the potency of your CBD mushroom oil tincture!</p>
<h2>What Are Cordyceps Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Cordyceps sinensis</i> (cordyceps) has been linked to stress reduction on the body, increasing resistance to stress-inducing activity. This mushroom is also considered a nootropic supplement due to its positive effects on the neurological system. Cordyceps mushrooms are often taken for a boost of energy (some even take it for libido). This mushroom is great for athletes and anyone looking to ease stress-related wear and tear on the body.</p>
<h2>What Are Chaga Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Inonotus obliquus</i> (chaga) has been taken for centuries to help with immunity and overall health. This mushroom gets its nickname, chaga, from a medieval Russian prince, who took it to treat his lip (<i>gaga</i>) cancer. While we don’t make any claims about the use of chaga for such a serious disease, we can tell you it&#8217;s commonly used for immune response. Chaga is also considered to be a nootropic mushroom, due to its positive effects on brain function.</p>
<h2>What Are Lion’s Mane Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>The bushy, thorny spines of <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> are responsible for this mushroom’s ferocious nickname, lion’s mane. This mushroom has traditionally been taken for its adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and inflammation. Lion’s mane is also considered to have the greatest nootropic effects of all mushrooms.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops Come From?</h2>

<h2>Get Up and Go! CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops</h2>
<p>Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops are the perfect way to start your day, with wellness boosting CBD, plus a powerful adaptogenic and nootropic mushroom blend for immune support, stress relief, energy and focus. These CBD mushroom drops are a great addition to any morning health regimen.</p>
<h2>The Power of Adaptogenic and Nootropic Mushrooms</h2>
<p>Mushrooms! Mushrooms! Mushrooms! The whole world seems to finally be waking up to the wellness benefits of our favorite fungi. Mushrooms have a long and interesting history that falls well beyond the tasty mushrooms we use to top our pizzas and salads. Medicinal mushroom extracts and blends have been around for millennia.</p>
<p>While we aren’t allowed (by law!) to make any medicinal claims — even as researchers continue to push forward with studies on medicinal mushroom formulas, and so forth — we can share with you the benefits that mushroom users have shared, literally, since the Chinese dynasties of the third millennium B.C.!</p>
<p>So, what are the wellness benefits that have spawned this recent mushroom revival?</p>
<h3>Understanding Adaptogens</h3>
<p>The term “adaptogen” was coined by a Russian scientist named Nikolai Lazarev shortly after World War II. In his studies, Lazarev wanted to unlock the secrets to better vitality for athletes, soldiers, and others. Adaptogenic substances refer to natural substances or supplements that reduce stress on the body.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of study on the adaptogenic properties of several mushrooms, including cordyceps, chaga, lion’s mane, reishi, maitake, and turkey tail. For our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops, we specifically use cordyceps, chaga, and lion’s mane.</p>
<h3>Understanding Nootropics</h3>
<p>Nootropics are substances and supplements that are believed to have beneficial effects on the brain and nervous tissue. This can include executive functions, creativity, memory, and energy/motivation. Lion’s mane is considered to be a great nootropic supplement, and perhaps the most powerful of all mushrooms in this area. Cordyceps and chaga are also considered to be nootropic mushrooms, delivering beneficial effects to the neurological system.</p>
<h3>How Do Adaptogenic and Noogenic Mushrooms Work in Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops?</h3>
<p>Our CBD Focus Mushroom: Energy Blend Drops contain three different mushrooms, each with its own unique and powerful properties.</p>
<h3>Cordyceps</h3>
<p>Cordyceps increases the body’s resistance to stress-inducing activity. That is, cordyceps helps the body to better deal with stress — which is the hallmark of adaptogenic mushrooms. Cordyceps is (yes, “cordyceps” is technically singular) also great for energizing the body and the mind — emblematic of the brain function support of nootropic mushrooms. The nice thing about cordyceps, as opposed to energy supplements like caffeine, is that this mushroom creates a natural energy that doesn’t give you a jittery feeling. When you take these proven mushroom extracts, you just get a powerful boost of vitality (some even take cordyceps for libido!). And with the addition of mind-calming CBD, that energy is focused. Athletes and everyday folks alike can tell you that focused energy is the best energy!</p>
<h3>Chaga</h3>
<p>Chaga has been taken for centuries (in ancient China and around the world) to help with immune response. Medieval Russian Prince Vladimir Monomakh II considered chaga to be the best of all medicinal mushrooms, reportedly taking this particular mushroom to cure his lip cancer. In fact, the name “chaga” comes from the Slavic word for “lip” (<i>gaga</i>). We won’t make any medical claims about mushroom blends with chaga or any other mushroom, for that matter (it’s not legal to do so!). But we will tell you that people have sworn by chaga as a great immune boost for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Lion’s Mane</h3>
<p>Lion’s mane is actually one of the most beautiful mushrooms you’ll ever see. These mushrooms are called lion’s mane because of their thick, bushy spines that resemble a lion’s mane. The Romans, on the other hand, thought lion’s mane looked like a fluffy hedgehog, which is what <i>erinaceus</i> means in the Latin name, <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>. However you choose to look at these mushrooms, lion’s mane has been revered for centuries for its adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and inflammation. Lion’s mane is also considered the best nootropic mushroom (supporting brain function). This is why lion’s mane mushroom extract continues to be a hot supplement for mushroom supplement companies.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Tinctures</h2>
<p>Along with unbeatable <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a>, CBD also has <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-mental-benefits-of-cbd/">calming properties</a> — particularly in broad spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/">terpenes</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/">flavonoids</a> of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp plant</a>. Mushrooms can also have multiple positive effects on the body, including adaptogenic (stress relief) benefits. Our blend of CBD, mushrooms, relaxation terpenes, and antioxidant-rich elderberry gives you a boost of wellness, along with a deep, satisfying feeling of relaxation.</p>
<h3>Calming</h3>
<p>Broad spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> has a wonderful calming effect that relaxes the mind and body. This is due, in part, to the presence of CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” in the oil. This tincture also features a proprietary blend of relaxing terpenes.</p>
<h3>Stress</h3>
<p>For centuries, reishi mushrooms have been taken as an adaptogenic supplement, lending stress relief to the mind and body. These mushrooms support the adrenal glands, which in turn release cortisol to help the body respond to stress.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several crucial systems and organs. Likewise, maitake mushrooms have long been prized for their immunity and wellness benefits.</p>
<h3>Immunity</h3>
<p>Like maitake mushrooms, turkey tail has also been taken for years as a boost to the immune system. This is due, in part, to polysaccharopeptides found in the turkey tail mushroom, which have powerful immune benefits.</p>

<h2>What Are Reishi Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>Nearly 5,000 years ago, reishi mushrooms were served to Chinese emperors and their royal families, and were referred to as “the mushroom of immortality.” <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> (reishi) is considered an adaptogen and is believed to help support the adrenal glands. This, in turn, releases cortisol to help the body respond to stress. Reishi mushrooms are also a rich source for vitamins (especially vitamin D), minerals, dietary fiber, and amino acids.</p>
<h2>What Are Maitake Mushrooms?</h2>
<p>Maitake means “dancing mushroom” in Japanese. <i>Grifola frondosa</i> got this name because people in feudal Japan would dance for joy when they found these valuable mushrooms. The reason maitake mushrooms were considered to be so valuable is because of their beneficial immunity and wellness properties. Among the nutrients in this delicious mushroom are vitamins B and C, potassium, copper and other minerals, amino acids, beta-glucans, fiber, and healthful antioxidants.</p>
<h2>What Are Turkey Tail Mushrooms?</h2>
<p><i>Trametes versicolor</i> is better known as turkey tail, not because it’s necessarily a Thanksgiving tradition, but more for its colorful, fan-like structure. Turkey tail mushrooms are well known for their beneficial immune properties. Turkey tail contains two different polysaccharopeptides, which have powerful benefits for the immune system. Turkey tail mushrooms are also stuffed with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, plus vitamins B3 and D.</p>

<h2>Mushrooms 101: Adaptogenic Mushrooms</h2>
<p>For many of us, mushrooms are the “fun” fungi we put on our pizzas, but there are several mushrooms in the world that have a vast amount of nutritional and wellness benefits. In fact, medicinal mushroom extracts and blends have been around for millennia.</p>
<p>Legally, we can’t (and won’t) make any medicinal claims about mushrooms (or CBD, for that matter. But there have been a number of research studies on medicinal mushroom formulas, and what we can do is share with you the benefits that mushroom users have shared for nearly 5,000 years.</p>
<p>So, what are the wellness benefits of those fabulous mushrooms and their wonderful extracts?</p>
<h3>What Are Adaptogens?</h3>
<p>A Russian scientist named Nikolai Lazarev coined the term “adaptogen” during the late 1940s. Lazarev wanted to unlock the secrets to better vitality for Russian athletes, soldiers, and others. His research centered around adaptogens, which are natural substances or supplements that reduce stress on the body.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of study, over the years, on the adaptogenic properties of several mushrooms, including cordyceps, lion’s mane, reishi, chaga, maitake, and turkey tail. For our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops, we specifically use reishi, maitake, and turkey tail.</p>
<h3>How Do Adaptogenic Mushrooms Work in Our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops?</h3>
<p>Our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops contain three different mushrooms, each with its own unique and powerful properties.</p>
<h3>Reishi</h3>
<p><i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>, better known as the reishi mushroom, has been revered for its nutrients and wellness properties as far back as the third millennium B.C. These mushrooms were considered so precious that they were served to the emperors and royal families of ancient China. Reishi was referred to as “the mushroom of immortality.” Reishi mushrooms are considered to be adaptogens and are believed to help support the adrenal glands, releasing cortisol to help in the body’s response to stress. They’re also a wonderful source for vitamins (vitamin D, in particular), minerals, dietary fiber, and amino acids. In a relaxation supplement, like our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops, reishi provides a perfect response to stress, with the added benefit of several key nutrients.</p>
<h3>Maitake</h3>
<p>The people of feudal Japan would dance for joy if they happened to find <i>Grifola frondosa</i> in the wild. That’s why they named this valuable mushroom the “dancing mushroom,” or maitake. Maitake mushrooms were considered to be so valuable because they were packed with nutrients and immune benefits. Among many nutrients in maitake mushrooms are vitamins B and C, potassium, copper and other minerals, amino acids, beta-glucans, fiber, and healthful antioxidants. We include maitake in our CBD Unwind Mushroom: Relax Blend Drops because they add a boost of wellness and immune benefits, helping to lift this tincture beyond a mere relaxation product to a true wellness supplement.</p>
<h3>Turkey Tail</h3>
<p>Turkey tail mushrooms (sometimes spelled as turkeytail) get their name because, well, they look just like the vibrant, fanlike tail of a turkey. They’re actually quite beautiful to see in the wild. Formally known as <i>Trametes versicolor</i>, these mushrooms are known for their beneficial immune properties. Turkey tail contains two different polysaccharopeptides, which are considered immunopotentiators. Immunopotentiators are compounds that activate immune cells through various receptors or pathways in the body. In short, turkey tail mushrooms have powerful benefits for the immune system. These mushrooms also have plenty of vitamin B3, vitamin D, antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, and are a healthful addition to this complex CBD, elderberry and mushroom blend.</p>

Available in a delicious black cherry flavor, these health-boosting gummies are great for daily wellness, as well as other benefits, including immune response, stress relief, anti-inflammatory support, and much more. CBD Wellness Mushroom Gummies are a healthy and tasty way to start your day!</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CBD Gummies With Mushrooms for Wellness</h2>
<p>For millennia, people have recognized the health and wellness potential in eating <strong>mushrooms</strong>. More recently, we’ve learned about the adaptogenic properties of many such fungi, as well as the nootropic effects of some mushrooms. These natural health supplements pair perfectly with CBD, the hottest wellness product on the market. Our <strong>CBD Mushroom Gummies</strong> give you seven potent mushrooms in a delicious black cherry-flavored gummy, making our Wellness Gummies a wonderful addition to any morning health regimen.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Mushrooms</h2>
<p>The <strong>benefits of mushrooms</strong> depend, to a large extent, on which mushrooms you’re talking about. We use seven different mushrooms in our Wellness Gummies: chaga, cordyceps, lion’s mane, reishi, maitake, turkey tail, and shiitake. Each of these <strong>shrooms</strong> is notable for having either adaptogenic or nootropic properties (some have both!).</p>
<p><strong>Adaptogens</strong> are chemical compounds that reduce stress on the body. <strong>Nootropics</strong> are compounds believed to improve cognitive function by stimulating the repair and growth of new nervous system cells, fighting inflammation in brain cells, maximizing oxygen use in brain and nervous tissue, and supporting mood and sleep.</p>
<p>All of the mushrooms we use are organically grown and wild harvested in the USA. The mushroom extracts we use are pulled from the sporocarp, or fruiting body, of the fungi using a clean water spraying method. The result is the purest and most potent mushroom extract available, with no residual chemicals in your gummies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at the shrooms used in our delightful gummies. Every serving delivers 7.1mg of each mushroom!</span></p>
<h3>Chaga</h3>
<p><strong>Chaga</strong> mushrooms are considered to have both adaptogenic and nootropic properties. These mushrooms have been used for many centuries for immune support, as well as overall health and wellness benefits. Chaga mushrooms are also packed with important vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B complex, vitamin D, potassium, and more.</p>
<h3>Cordyceps</h3>
<p><strong><em>C</em></strong><strong>ordyceps</strong> are also believed to have both adaptogenic and nootropic benefits. Cordyceps mushrooms have been studied for their potential to help reduce stress on the body, increasing resistance to stress-inducing activity. These mushrooms are often used to provide energy (some even take cordyceps to boost libido), and are a wonderful source for vitamins B1, B2, B12 and K.</p>
<h3>Lion’s Mane</h3>
<p>Traditionally, <strong>lion’s mane</strong> mushrooms (sometimes called “lion mane”) have been taken for their adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and stop inflammation. Lion’s mane is also believed to have positive nootropic benefits for the brain and neurological system. These mushrooms are a valuable source of vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy carbohydrates, amino acids, and more.</p>
<h3>Reishi</h3>
<p><strong>Reishi</strong> mushrooms are also commonly used for their adaptogenic benefits. Reishi is believed to support the adrenal glands, which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. These mushrooms are a potent source of vitamins (especially vitamin D), minerals, amino acids, and dietary fiber.</p>
<h3>Maitake</h3>
<p><strong>Maitake</strong> is another adaptogenic mushroom, long taken for its beneficial immunity, antioxidant, and wellness effects. Among maitake’s many nutrients are vitamins B and C, copper and other minerals, potassium, beta-glucans, amino acids, and fiber.</p>
<h3>Turkey tail (a.k.a. Turkeytail)</h3>
<p><strong>Turkey tail</strong> is an adaptogenic mushroom, well known for its immune support stemming from two different polysaccharopeptides, which are abundant in this healthful fungus. Turkey tail also contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, as well as vitamins B3 and D.</p>
<h3>Shiitake</h3>
<p><strong>Shiitake</strong> mushrooms are considered both adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms. These potent mushrooms are rich in polysaccharides, such as lentians and other beta-glucans, which protect against cell damage, promote immune function, and have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<h2>How Do CBD Mushroom Gummies Work?</h2>
<p>CBD Mushroom Gummies are edibles (to state the obvious). Simply eat two gummies to get a full dose of CBD (25mg CBD per gummy; 50mg CBD per serving) and health-boosting mushrooms.</p>
<p>As gummies are edibles, the CBD and other beneficial compounds in this gummy product will need to travel through the digestive tract before being absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on bioavailability factors, including height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and CBD tolerance. The calming CBD effects can last for as long as six to eight hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors.</p>
<p>Store your CBD Mushroom Gummies at room temperature, away from light (in a drawer or cupboard) as direct light may degrade the product over time.</p>
<p>Please be advised that our gummies do not contain “<strong>magic mushrooms</strong>,” which are psychedelic shrooms containing the compound, psilocybin.</p>
<h2>Shopping for the Best CBD &amp; Mushroom Products</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, every product we sell is made with CBD derived from organic hemp. This means you won’t have to worry about pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins making their way into your gummies. And that CBD oil is extracted from the hemp plant with clean, efficient carbon dioxide, which doesn’t leave behind any potentially harmful residues, as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and the potency of your CBD Mushroom Gummies by checking the <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (<strong>COA</strong>), which is a third-party lab report we provide for every product we sell. This report will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any toxins. At CBDfx, your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns!</p>
