<h2>The Benefits of CBD Cat Tincture</h2>
<p>Our <b>CBD oil for cats</b> contains a bevy of wellness benefits to give your <b>cat</b> a happier, healthier life. And with our delicious new chicken flavor, they’ll love to take it!</p>
<h3>Calming</h3>
<p><b>CBD</b> has a wonderful calming effect that relaxes the mind and body. This is great for many <b>cats</b>, who get nervous and stressed out by loud noises and unfamiliar people or places.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with your cat’s endocannabinoid system, which helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs.</p>
<h3>Joint Relief</h3>
<p>Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, many find that CBD can help with acute and chronic inflammation that causes joint pain in cats and other pets.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Oil Work for Cats?</h2>
<p>Like all vertebrate animals, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-complete-guide-to-buying-cbd-for-cats/">cats</a> have an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-endocannabinoid-system-in-cats-and-dogs/">endocannabinoid system</a>. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">The ECS</a> is a cell-signaling system that interacts with various systems and organs in the body, most notably the central and peripheral nervous systems, and helps them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/">CBD</a> and other <b>cannabinoids</b> mimic this process in the body, bringing a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wealth of wellness benefits</a>.</p>
<h2>What Does MCT Oil Do?</h2>
<p>Medium-chain triglyceride oil (MCT oil) helps your cat’s body to absorb the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> faster and more thoroughly, which means your cat will feel the effects of the CBD tincture more quickly.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx CBD Cat Tincture the Best CBD Oil for Cats?</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">CBDfx</a>, we make sure that all of our CBD is derived exclusively from <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp plants</a> organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms, and is extracted by means of clean CO2. We want you to know that when you buy a CBD product from us, such as our CBD Cat Tincture, it will be as potent as we claim on the label and the absolute <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-best-cbd-oil-for-cats/">purest, safest product you can buy</a>.</p>
<h2>How Can I Know the Oil in My CBD Cat Tincture Is Organic?</h2>
<p>Always look for lab reports conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory, when you’re shopping for CBD. Every reputable CBD company will provide such reports. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for each and every product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBD cat oil and rest assured that it contains no contaminants!</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD Oil in CBD Cat Tincture Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in Kentucky, and our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the U.S. Government.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hemp we use is organically grown, pesticide-free, and contains no GMOs. This ensures that your CBD is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in CBD products from less reputable brands.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized extraction process that utilizes clean CO2 to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant, leaving behind no solvents as you might find in CBD products from brands that use cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic, highly purified CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with only natural ingredients, which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol class="ml-0" start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD products — including CBD oil for cats — are quality tested by an independent third-party laboratory. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers to see via a QR code on the CBD product packaging or on our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The organic CBD oil used in our <b>CBD Cat Tincture</b> is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, which comes from organically grown hemp and is extracted with clean CO2. See how broad spectrum oil compares to other types of CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Contains all the chemical compounds found in the buds, leaves, and stalks of the hemp plant, including THC (less than 0.3%).</p>
<h3>Broad Spectrum CBD</h3>
<p>Inside the pie chart: change Terpenes to: Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Flavonoids, Fatty Acids</p>
<p>Under the chart:</p>
<p>Detectable levels of THC have been filtered out, along with some other hemp content.</p>
<h3>CBD Isolate</h3>
<p>All other plant matter has been removed, leaving 99% pure CBD.</p>
<h2>Read a Product Review or Ask a Question</h2>
<p>Whether you’ve got a question for our CBD customer service experts, want to leave a review, or are just interested to hear what others are saying about our cat CBD oil or other products, our community is the place to be!</p>
<h2>Explore the Best Pet Blog for CBD — and More!</h2>
<p>Our informative blog articles keep you informed on products, like our CBD oil tincture for cats, as well as other great topics on CBD, cats, dogs, cannabis, and more!</p>
<h2>Show Your Feline Love With CBD Oil for Cats!</h2>
<p>Your feline friend deserves the very best in life. Our CBD cat tinctures — and yes, there is a second <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-for-cats/">CBD Oil for Cats with bacon flavor</a>! — give your cat wonderful CBD calming benefits, plus <a href="https://cbdfx.com/can-i-give-cbd-to-my-cat/">a wealth of wellness</a> in each and every one of these delicious drops. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/dogs-cats-and-cbd/">Your cat’s CBD tinctures</a> were designed to ease their stress, improve their health and mobility, and give them a lasting sense of calm.</p>
<h2>Vegan Oil for Cats That Tastes Like Chicken!</h2>
<p>CBD for cats can be unpleasant, if you don’t consider your cat’s taste buds. No one enjoys forcing a dose of any oil, let alone a hemp CBD oil, into their cat’s mouth. If your cat doesn’t see the drops of pet CBD oil as treats, you’re bound to lose a finger! That’s why we formulated our organic CBD oil for cats with a delicious natural flavoring, guaranteed to water the mouth of even the most finicky of cats. The best thing about the flavoring of our CBD oil for cats is that this oil is a vegan product, yet still tastes remarkably like real chicken. Whether your pet is a cat or a dog (and we do have tasty oil CBD products for your dog, too!), your pet will certainly enjoy this delicious hemp product.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take for My Cat to Feel the Effects of CBD?</h2>
<p>Every cat is different, and so results may vary for every feline. There’s also the method of delivery to consider. For humans, taking CBD as an oil can mean absorbing it sublingually, by holding the oil under your tongue for a minute before swallowing. This allows for rapid absorption of the CBD into the bloodstream. Try explaining that to a cat!</p>
<p>Certainly, your CBD oil for cats will be swallowed and the CBD will be absorbed through the digestive tract. But while edible CBD can take a human up to two hours to fully kick in, it’s not likely that your cat will take that long to feel the effects of the CBD. Your cat has a much faster metabolism than a human, so the cat will naturally absorb the CBD faster. So, while it could take your cat up to 90 minutes to feel the effects of your CBD oil for cats, it will likely be much faster.</p>
<h2>The Last Word on Our CBD Cat Tincture</h2>
<p>We want our cats to enjoy life. We want our feline friends to be happy and healthy. Our CBD oil gives your cat gentle calmness to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cats-and-the-3-a-m-zoomies/">settle their nerves</a>, and all of the wellness benefits of CBD. We’re sure your cat will love it!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We love our cats. And when it comes to caring for the health and well-being of our feline companions, we’d do anything to keep them purring. Many veterinarians recommend CBD for cats, to improve their wellness and help calm their nerves. Our CBD oil tincture for cats is the perfect strength for their small size, and brings them all the same wellness benefits of CBD as it does to humans. Our CBD balm for cats soothes their dry skin and helps heal irritations, particularly on the paws and nose. Like all of our CBD products for pets, our CBD cat products are organic, vegan, and all-natural.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans have used </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/seeds-to-space-a-history-of-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp for centuries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for everything from rope and paper to medicinal applications. Hemp was even used in animal feed, as a low-priced, nutritious filler. In recent years, many hemp-derived products have focused on the wellness and calming aspects of CBD and other compounds called cannabinoids, which are found in abundance in the hemp plant. As a result, CBD’s popularity has exploded, with hemp-derived products as diverse as </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-gummies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD gummies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD tinctures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD topicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cookies-with-protein/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the market. One area that has grown greatly in recent years is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-pets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for pets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly dogs and cats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for cats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a no-brainer for a lot of cat owners, particularly when those kitties decide to turn the house into the Talladega Superspeedway at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 in the morning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But besides serving as a natural sleep aid for cats, there are other ways that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-cbd-safe-for-cats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD can help your feisty feline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CBD can relieve stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity, as well as boost their general wellness. CBD also has topical applications for cats, particularly with dry and irritated skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With both CBD oil for cats and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD balm for cats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available, CBD has become a must-have part of every cat owner’s pet supply pantry.</span></p>
<h3><b>Cats and Cannabinoids</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a protective cat parent, it’s natural to ask, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is CBD safe for cats&lt;/span<span style="font-weight: 400;">?” </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/can-i-give-cbd-to-my-cat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a resounding “yes.” While study on CBD and cannabis, in general, is still running in catch-up mode, </span><a href="https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/faqs-about-cbd-use-pets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anecdotal evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is overwhelmingly positive. In order to better understand the effect of CBD on cats, perhaps it’s a good idea to provide a little background.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all mammals, felines have an </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/do-your-pets-have-an-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This system interacts with the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to regulate several key bodily functions, including mood, sleep, immunity, appetite, memory, pain management, and more. CBD (or cannabidiol) is one of a group of chemical compounds, called cannabinoids, that are found in the hemp plant. When consumed, these compounds bind to receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping to enhance its effectiveness in several of these key functions. Think of hemp-derived CBD as a safe, all-natural booster for one of your cat’s most vital systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, THC is a cannabinoid, too. And THC is not healthy for your pet. It should be avoided at all costs. Fortunately, CBD pet products all have below 0.1% THC levels, as required by the FDA. And unlike THC, cannabidiol is non-psychoactive, meaning it won’t get your cat “high.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Stress, Hyperactivity, and the Zoomies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cats can be … difficult</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of that is just good fun. They like to go nuts and run around. Some of it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard-wired into their nature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, the innate hunting schedule of a cat is between 3 and 5 in the morning — so there’s science behind their late-night insanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cats can also suffer from </span><a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/c_ct_fear_phobia_anxiety" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cat anxiety can manifest in lack of appetite, constant hiding, hypervigilance, and other ways. This can have long-term deleterious effects on their health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD calming products can ease their stress, and help them better integrate into your household and any other situation that might upset them, from energetic children to loud cars or fireworks. Our CBD Pet Tincture gives your cat the calming relief of broad spectrum CBD in a delicious, all-natural hemp oil, with the strength tailor-made for the size and weight of a cat. Mix it into their favorite food or feed it to them straight from the dropper. They’ll enjoy the flavor and, more importantly, they’ll experience the calming wellness benefits of CBD. One last note of importance: all of our CBD hemp oil for pets is organic, non-GMO, and vegan — so you can be assured you’re giving your BFF the very best.</span></p>
<h3><b>Dry and Cracked Skin</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cats can get dry skin for a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of different reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including dry air, poor grooming or bathing, nutritional deficiencies, and more. Their paw pads can also become irritated by rough or hot surfaces. If left unchecked, this dryness can cause cracked skin and even hair loss. That cracked skin can become inflamed or, worse, infected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your cat’s skin healthy and moisturized, try </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming and Moisturizing CBD Pet Balm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This balm for cats and dogs soothes and protects your kitty’s skin, alleviating discomfort and inflammation, and protecting them against future dryness. With broad spectrum CBD, odorless Alaskan salmon oil, soothing shea butter, and healthy essential oils, this CBD cat balm is a natural way to keep your feline friend happy and purring.</span></p>
<h3><b>Purity and Effectiveness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CBDfx, we use only the purest organic hemp to make our CBD products — including CBD for cats. All of our hemp is grown in the state of Kentucky and processed under the strict cannabis guidelines of the FDA. We use a third-party laboratory to test all of our products, and we make those </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/lab-reports/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available for everyone to see. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests show you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not only how much CBD and other ingredients are in your cannabis product, but they also tell you the levels of things that should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be in your product, like pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals that can be soaked up from the soil around the hemp plant or during the oil extraction process. With organic farming and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safe CO2 extraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we provide you and your kitty with the safest, purest CBD products on the market.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm provides soothing relief for your dog or cat’s dry or inflamed skin, nose and paws. With 750mg of calming and wellness-enriching CBD, plus the multifaceted benefits of odorless Alaskan salmon oil and moisturizing shea butter, and a variety of gently comforting essential oils — lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile — it’s the perfect Pet CBD Balm.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm</h2>
<p>Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm is a must for pet owners, who understand that their dog or cat deals with a variety of potentially serious skin issues, particularly on the nose and paws. This pet CBD balm protects and moisturizes the skin with all-natural ingredients, including organic broad spectrum CBD, harvested and processed right here in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Not only does this CBD balm for pets feature hemp-extracted CBD, but it also boasts additional hemp seed oil, which contains three healthy, polyunsaturated fatty acids: linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid. These fatty acids strengthen the skin, assist it in combating infection, and have multiple anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Our CBD pet balm features other key ingredients as well, which further enhance its effects. Odorless Alaskan salmon oil contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties, promote a healthy skin and coat, and have other wellness benefits. Shea butter moisturizes dry skin, reduces inflammation, and provides soothing relief to itchy and peeling skin. Candelilla wax hydrates and smoothes parched, scaly skin. And on top of all that, we’ve added a blend of lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile essential oils to nurture your dog or cat’s skin even further. Taken together, these ingredients provide welcome relief for pets suffering from skin issues.</p>
<h3>Why Does My Dog Need CBD Balm?</h3>
<p>It would be nice if our dog or cat could tell us when they’re irritated or hurting. Dog paws can be particularly sensitive. They harden and dry out for a variety of reasons, from aging to surface wear. When this happens, the paw pad skin can crack, which can easily lead to inflammation, infection, and general discomfort. Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm not only soothes the pain that accompanies this cracked skin, but also moisturizes, smoothes and protects the skin so that it can heal.</p>
<p>Dog noses are also prone to drying out, particularly in hot sun or cold weather — much like our human lips chap if we don’t protect them with lip balm. Given that dogs’ most powerful sense is smell, that sniffer gets an intense workout nearly every waking moment. So, keeping their nose hydrated and protected is a must.</p>
<p>Our CBD balm for pets can be used on any area of the skin that is reddened, irritated or inflamed. Just make sure to keep it away from your pupper’s eyes.</p>
<h3>Can I Use CBD Balm on My Cat?</h3>
<p>Because cats are so much smaller than the average dog, we sometimes forget that they can have similar health issues. As with dogs, a cat’s skin, paws and nose can dry out, and get irritated, inflamed or infected. So, it’s a good idea for cat owners to also keep CBD Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm on hand, so that their kitties’ pouncing peds and boopy noses remain hydrated and healthy.</p>
<h3>IS CBD Safe for Pets?</h3>
<p>Like humans and other mammals, dogs and cats have an endocannabinoid system, which regulates and balances sleep, immune response, communication between cells, appetite and metabolism, memory, and other vital processes. Their bodies, in fact, produce their own cannabinoids. The cannabinoids found in the hemp plant, known as phytocannabinoids, have been found to support and bolster this system, leading to a variety of wellness benefits.</p>
<p>And no, CBD won’t get your pet — or you — “high.” THC is the cannabinoid that provides the intoxicating effects everyone associates with marijuana. Because CBD is processed from the hemp plant, rather than from marijuana, it is nearly THC free — with legal amounts in CBD products at the nearly undetectable level of less than 0.3%. So, your dog or cat is not only safe in using this natural topical, but also they won’t be stumbling around your house because of it.</p>
<h3>How Does Alaskan Salmon Oil Help My Pet?</h3>
<p>Salmon oil is an incredibly nutrient-rich supplement. For years, humans have taken fish oil to support everything from heart health to immune function. This stems from two fatty acids that are readily available in the oil: omega-3 and omega-6 acids. For the skin, these fatty acids serve as an effective anti-inflammatory, as well as make the skin appear shiny and vibrant. The omega-3 acid known as eicosapentaenoic acid, in particular, produces arachidonic acid, which restricts the growth of pro-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p>Oh, and we agree that salmon can be pretty darned stinky around the house. That’s why our Alaskan salmon oil is processed to be completely odor-free, so you won’t have to worry about your pet offending.</p>
