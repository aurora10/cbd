Our Sweet Dreams Drops are a potent combination of full spectrum CBD, CBN (the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”), and sleep terpenes, plus the added boost of super-chill THC! Our Purple Punch Vape Pen also combines full spectrum CBD, CBN, and THC — but with the near-immediate effects of a vape pen.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBN: Sweet Dreams Blend</h2>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> that are a result of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. In terms of calming, nothing beats the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” CBN, which is a vital component of our sleep tincture. <b>THC</b> also delivers relaxation benefits, as well as wellness benefits and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful (and natural) alternative to prescription sleeping pills and other drug store sleep aids.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil has a wonderful calming effect on the mind and body. CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” takes that calming effect to the next level with deep, restful properties. Delta-9 THC and sleep terpenes also help the mind and body to unwind before bed.</p>
<h3>Deeper Sleep</h3>
<p>Every ingredient in these delta-9 sleep drops is formulated to not only help you fall asleep, but to also sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions.</p>
<h3>No “Hangover”</h3>
<p>With most sleeping pills, you can wake up in the morning feeling groggy and just plain lousy. With our THC sleep oil, there are no ill after-effects. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>When CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, it helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, which include stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the CBD oil that is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Among the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> found in full spectrum CBD are CBD (of course), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are other THC cannabinoids (such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC), delta-9 is the version of THC that is most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. The full name of delta-9 is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has several wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is derived from the hemp plant (not marijuana) and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a CBD product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms (in the great state of Kentucky!), and extracted with clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and test results are made available to all visitors on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Sleep Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN, or THC products, always look for a lab report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent lab reports for all of their products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + THC oil and rest assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC oil is taken sublingually</a> — that is, absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries under the tongue — the effects are felt much more quickly than they are when you simply swallow the oil. If you simply swallow your tincture oil, the CBD, CBN and THC have to travel through your digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. If you take your CBD oil sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in the United States — in Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in cannabis hemp farming. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our organically grown hemp is pesticide-free and contains no GMOs. You can rest assured that your CBD product is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in products from less reputable CBD brands.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes carbon dioxide to extract the CBD oil from the cannabis hemp plant, leaving behind no potentially harmful solvents as with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the highly purified, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li aria-level="1">
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD and delta-9 products are quality tested by an independent, third-party lab. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers on the front page of our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, derived from organically grown hemp and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">extracted with clean CO2</a>. See how full spectrum CBD oil compares to other types of CBD.<br />

<h2>Sweet Dreams Are Made of This: Delta-9 THC Drops + CBN</h2>
<p>Our Delta 9 Sweet Dreams oil drops are the finest in natural sleep supplements. Featuring organic full spectrum CBD, CBN (the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid), delta-9 THC, and sleep terpenes, this tincture is formulated to not only get you to sleep quickly, but to help you sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions. Our delta-9 sleep tincture gives you all of these sleep benefits without the morning hangover that comes with many sleeping pills. Enjoy your best sleep ever with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>The Power of Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend begins with full spectrum CBD. As we mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the hemp plant, with no cannabis materials filtered out. This means full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the term used to describe the phenomenon in which the various compounds of the hemp plant — all of the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, CBN, THC, and the rest of the compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our CBN oil for sleep), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken alone.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Sleep Oil</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). This is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. Like other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, yes, delta-9 can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with a wealth of wellness benefits — and it has many restful properties that make it the perfect ingredient for a natural CBD sleep oil.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our oil extract after the THC has been measured and increased the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>CBN: The Ultimate Relaxation Cannabinoid</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, better known as CBN, is one of the most famous and important of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of THC, meaning that it is formed when the composition of THC is altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the intoxicating properties of THC, it does carry over the relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + CBN + THC for Sleep</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 products (including our sleep tincture and chill tincture) is formulated with your health in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible and to help you on your journey to better living. Our full spectrum sleep oil can help you get a better night’s sleep, which is vital for good health. We wish you all the best on your wellness journey!</p>

<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the CBD Effects of a Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC is taken sublingually</a> — that is, held under the tongue and absorbed through the capillaries into the bloodstream — the effects are felt much more quickly than if you simply swallow it. If you just swallow your tincture, the CBD and THC have to travel through the digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. Sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on factors such as your weight, height, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in Delta-9 THC Drops + CBD: Ultimate Chill Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is American-grown in the state of Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in hemp farming. All of our hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<h3>Cultivation</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hemp we use is organically grown and pesticide-free, with no GMOs. This ensures that your CBD is free from all pesticides, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals commonly found in less reputable CBD products.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Extraction</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We use a specialized process that utilizes clean CO2 to extract the CBD oil from the hemp plant, leaving behind no solvents as with other cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the organic, highly purified CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients, which are all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Lab-Tested</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our CBD products are quality tested by an independent, third-party laboratory. The results of these tests are made available for all of our customers to see on our website.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD</h2>
<p>The CBD used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, which is derived from organically grown hemp and is extracted by means of clean CO2.

<h2>A Deep Dive Into Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>Understanding the wellness benefits of our CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend begins with understanding just what full spectrum CBD is. As we noted above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the cannabis hemp plant, with none of the plant materials filtered out. This means the oil contains all of the cannabinoids from the hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and non-intoxicating trace amounts of THC. Full spectrum CBD also contains healthful terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the phenomenon in which the different compounds of the hemp plant — cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD and the other compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would on its own.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD + THC</h3>
<p>We mentioned that full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC). This is the legal threshold for THC content, and is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. THC also contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, while delta-9 certainly can have intoxicating properties if taken in a high enough dosage, delta-9 can also help you to achieve some of your wellness goals.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of THC products is to maximize that potential. With the legal threshold of THC content at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our extract after the THC has been measured and bumped up the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible. So, consider this THC legal THC and consider these products THC products you can use to boost your wellness potential!</p>
<h2>Go for Quality</h2>
<p>The tinctures top brands sell come with the guarantee of an independent third-party lab report. When you shop an online store for delta-9 (or really, any THC or CBD product), make sure your delta-9 product comes with such a report. This will tell you the exact mg of CBD, the exact mg of THC, and the exact mg of pretty much every cannabinoid and other compound. Additionally, the report will tell you which companies or brands are not using organic delta-9, as they will show (again, down to the mg), the amount of contaminants in your delta-9 product. Likewise, if your delta-9 product was not extracted with clean CO2 (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/">as we use at CBDfx</a>), you will see the mg of chemical solvent residues, as well. For purity and potency, insist on CBD and delta-9 products that come with reports from independent, third-party labs. If a company doesn’t provide such reports, avoid their products!</p>
