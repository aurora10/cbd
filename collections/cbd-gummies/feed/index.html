<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, however, that if you’re new to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, you should consider trying half a gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the gummy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our </span><b>delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products (including our Magic Melon </span><b>THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious </span><b>sativa gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabidiol, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for short, interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeostasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (balance) in several vital systems and organs, including the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. This interaction between CBD and the ECS helps the various systems and organs to regulate important functions such as sleep, memory, motor control, immune, mood, appetite, stress and pain management, and more. These beneficial effects are the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement. </span></p>
<p><b>Full spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil, the oil used in our </span><b>Delta-9 THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (delta-9 THC) has a bevy of wellness benefits as well, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids produce multiple benefits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis connoisseurs generally associate sativa strains with feelings of exhilaration, mood enhancement, and creativity. This uplifting feeling provides a wonderful complement to the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil can have calming effects for the mind and body. Delta-9 THC also has deep restful qualities, making this cannabinoid combination ideal for long, relaxed “chill” sessions.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, CBD interacts with receptors in the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several of its most important systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol also carries a host of wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, soothing relief for pain and stress, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the extract initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust oil extract includes wellness-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and tiny traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by US law).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, instead of simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many CBD users prefer the power of full spectrum CBD oil products!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the cannabis compound that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana (it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, which are considered minor cannabinoids (meaning there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis). Delta-8 and delta-10 THC have somewhat different effects than the major cannabinoid, delta-9 THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While delta-9 THC can definitely get you high if you take it in large enough amounts, it also has several wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) only contain THC derived from hemp. All of these products are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects (via the Entourage Effect). And in a product featuring 30mg of CBD per serving, along with 10mg of THC, that means your two major cannabinoids will be working in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, giving you a deeper cannabinoid experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are scientists who classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three categories: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when you consume it. Sativa effects have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Magic Melon Sativa is formulated to share these effects, but is still compliant with legal THC limits. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every product </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold by CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is made with organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, THC and mushroom products (including high-potency delta-9 THC gummies) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD hemp oil has been extracted by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as with some cheaper extraction methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC and mushroom products by </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which accompany every product on our website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so that you can trust their accuracy. These reports allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. You can “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</span></p>

These delicious edibles are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the health and wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeostasis</a>, or balance, in several vital systems and organs. Most notably, this includes the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain.

<p><strong>Full spectrum CBD</strong> oil, which is the oil used in our <strong>Delta-9 THC Gummies</strong>, is particularly beneficial, as it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Delta-9 THC (<strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids can produce multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis connoisseurs tend to associate sativa strains with mood enhancement, feelings of exhilaration, and bursts of creativity. This uplifting feeling works wonderfully with the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> can have calming effects for the mind and for the body. Delta-9 THC also has deeply relaxing qualities, making this cannabinoid combo perfect for long, unwind-the-mind “chill” sessions.</p>

<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together, instead of merely working in parallel with one another, these compounds actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a major reason why many CBD customers prefer the robust cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid generally associated with the intoxicating, or psychoactive, effects of marijuana. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the one that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. While delta-9 THC can certainly get you high if you take enough of it, it also has several wellness benefits, including mood elevation, muscle relaxation, pain and stress management, sleep support, and more. All THC used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) is derived from hemp, and falls below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed how multiple cannabinoids work together to actually bolster each other’s effects (the Entourage Effect). Don’t forget that THC is also a cannabinoid and, as such, delta-9 can work to boost the effects of your CBD — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, though, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three types: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This separation is generally based on leaf shape and the effects the plant generates when you consume it. The effects of cannabis sativa have generally been observed to be mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), inspiration/creativity, and anxiety reduction. Our Berry Buzz Sativa blend is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established under US law.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD, THC, and mushroom product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including this full spectrum high potency delta-9 THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by means of clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as is the case with some cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, mushroom, and delta-9 THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a>, which we provide for every product on our website. All of the best CBD brands will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. These lab reports allow you to verify that our CBD, mushroom, and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on our website and on the product label.</p>
<p>Because our CBD and THC products deliver in terms of both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx to have the best CBD products, and consider our THC gummies to be the very <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>CBD and delta-9 THC gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (yes) you eat them. This means the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into the bloodstream through your digestive system. Because of this, it takes longer to feel the effects of CBD edibles, such as CBD gummies or CBD cookies, than it does when you take a CBD or THC sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of a THC gummy.</p>
<p>On the plus side, edibles like our THC gummies stay in your bloodstream for a much longer period of time than CBD vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel the effects of a CBD edible for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your delta-9 THC or CBD product.</p>

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our THC + CBD Gummies: Indica Blend</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with the endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">homeostasis</a> (balance) in several crucial systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and the brain. This interaction helps to regulate such functions as sleep, memory, mood, appetite, motor control, pain and stress management, and much more. These effects are what make CBD such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD, which is the CBD oil used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Gummies, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids of the hemp plant. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus wonderful relaxation effects (especially in indica strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies).</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have gentle calming benefits for the mind and body, as does natural melatonin. Delta-9 THC, particularly in indica cannabis strains, has a deep, restful quality to it, as well!</p>
<h3>Enhanced Sleep</h3>
<p>Indica cannabis strains, as used in our Lemon Dream THC Gummies, have long been used to help with sleep. With additional full spectrum CBD and melatonin, these delta-9 gummies can be a wonderful sleep product.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several crucial systems and organs. Delta-9 THC also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>The oil that is initially extracted from the hemp plant contains all of the chemical content of the hemp buds, leaves, and stalks. This includes wellness-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. In fact, there are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). This robust and healthful hemp oil is called full spectrum CBD.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>A curious thing happens when CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together. Instead of merely working in parallel with one another, CBD and the various cannabinoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a big reason why many CBD users prefer the rich cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid most associated with the psychoactive effects of marijuana (it’s the one that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC. While delta-9 can get you high if you take enough of it, this THC compound also has several wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more.

<h3>THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We mentioned all of those cannabinoids working together to bolster each other’s effects. Don’t forget that THC is a cannabinoid and, yes, delta-9 does work to make your CBD effects more pronounced — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>While there is some disagreement within the scientific community about exactly how to classify cannabis (some want to classify <i>all</i> cannabis as sativa), users have traditionally divided cannabis into three types, based on leaf shape and the effects on the consumer. These three types of cannabis are cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. Generally speaking, the effects of indica are largely observed to be relaxation of the mind and body, as well as sleep benefits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made with organically grown hemp oil.

					<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our CBD Gummies With Mushrooms for Wellness combine the calming wellness benefits of CBD with the adaptogenic and nootropic properties of cordyceps, chaga, turkey tail, lion’s mane, and other mushrooms (50mg per serving!). Available in a delicious black cherry flavor, these health-boosting gummies are great for daily wellness, as well as other benefits, including immune response, stress relief, anti-inflammatory support, and much more. CBD Wellness Mushroom Gummies are a healthy and tasty way to start your day!</span>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CBD Gummies With Mushrooms for Wellness</h2>
<p>For millennia, people have recognized the health and wellness potential in eating <strong>mushrooms</strong>. More recently, we’ve learned about the adaptogenic properties of many such fungi, as well as the nootropic effects of some mushrooms. These natural health supplements pair perfectly with CBD, the hottest wellness product on the market. Our <strong>CBD Mushroom Gummies</strong> give you seven potent mushrooms in a delicious black cherry-flavored gummy, making our Wellness Gummies a wonderful addition to any morning health regimen.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Mushrooms</h2>
<p>The <strong>benefits of mushrooms</strong> depend, to a large extent, on which mushrooms you’re talking about. We use seven different mushrooms in our Wellness Gummies: chaga, cordyceps, lion’s mane, reishi, maitake, turkey tail, and shiitake. Each of these <strong>shrooms</strong> is notable for having either adaptogenic or nootropic properties (some have both!).</p>
<p><strong>Adaptogens</strong> are chemical compounds that reduce stress on the body. <strong>Nootropics</strong> are compounds believed to improve cognitive function by stimulating the repair and growth of new nervous system cells, fighting inflammation in brain cells, maximizing oxygen use in brain and nervous tissue, and supporting mood and sleep.</p>
<p>All of the mushrooms we use are organically grown and wild harvested in the USA. The mushroom extracts we use are pulled from the sporocarp, or fruiting body, of the fungi using a clean water spraying method. The result is the purest and most potent mushroom extract available, with no residual chemicals in your gummies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a look at the shrooms used in our delightful gummies. Every serving delivers 7.1mg of each mushroom!</span></p>
<h3>Chaga</h3>
<p><strong>Chaga</strong> mushrooms are considered to have both adaptogenic and nootropic properties. These mushrooms have been used for many centuries for immune support, as well as overall health and wellness benefits. Chaga mushrooms are also packed with important vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B complex, vitamin D, potassium, and more.</p>
<h3>Cordyceps</h3>
<p><strong><em>C</em></strong><strong>ordyceps</strong> are also believed to have both adaptogenic and nootropic benefits. Cordyceps mushrooms have been studied for their potential to help reduce stress on the body, increasing resistance to stress-inducing activity. These mushrooms are often used to provide energy (some even take cordyceps to boost libido), and are a wonderful source for vitamins B1, B2, B12 and K.</p>
<h3>Lion’s Mane</h3>
<p>Traditionally, <strong>lion’s mane</strong> mushrooms (sometimes called “lion mane”) have been taken for their adaptogenic benefits, helping the body to regulate stress and stop inflammation. Lion’s mane is also believed to have positive nootropic benefits for the brain and neurological system. These mushrooms are a valuable source of vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy carbohydrates, amino acids, and more.</p>
<h3>Reishi</h3>
<p><strong>Reishi</strong> mushrooms are also commonly used for their adaptogenic benefits. Reishi is believed to support the adrenal glands, which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. These mushrooms are a potent source of vitamins (especially vitamin D), minerals, amino acids, and dietary fiber.</p>
<h3>Maitake</h3>
<p><strong>Maitake</strong> is another adaptogenic mushroom, long taken for its beneficial immunity, antioxidant, and wellness effects. Among maitake’s many nutrients are vitamins B and C, copper and other minerals, potassium, beta-glucans, amino acids, and fiber.</p>
<h3>Turkey tail (a.k.a. Turkeytail)</h3>
<p><strong>Turkey tail</strong> is an adaptogenic mushroom, well known for its immune support stemming from two different polysaccharopeptides, which are abundant in this healthful fungus. Turkey tail also contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, as well as vitamins B3 and D.</p>
<h3>Shiitake</h3>
<p><strong>Shiitake</strong> mushrooms are considered both adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms. These potent mushrooms are rich in polysaccharides, such as lentians and other beta-glucans, which protect against cell damage, promote immune function, and have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<h2>How Do CBD Mushroom Gummies Work?</h2>
<p>CBD Mushroom Gummies are edibles (to state the obvious). Simply eat two gummies to get a full dose of CBD (25mg CBD per gummy; 50mg CBD per serving) and health-boosting mushrooms.</p>
<p>As gummies are edibles, the CBD and other beneficial compounds in this gummy product will need to travel through the digestive tract before being absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on bioavailability factors, including height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and CBD tolerance. The calming CBD effects can last for as long as six to eight hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors.</p>
<p>Store your CBD Mushroom Gummies at room temperature, away from light (in a drawer or cupboard) as direct light may degrade the product over time.</p>
<p>Please be advised that our gummies do not contain “<strong>magic mushrooms</strong>,” which are psychedelic shrooms containing the compound, psilocybin.</p>
<h2>Shopping for the Best CBD &amp; Mushroom Products</h2>
<p>At CBDfx, every product we sell is made with CBD derived from organic hemp. This means you won’t have to worry about pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins making their way into your gummies. And that CBD oil is extracted from the hemp plant with clean, efficient carbon dioxide, which doesn’t leave behind any potentially harmful residues, as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and the potency of your CBD Mushroom Gummies by checking the <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (<strong>COA</strong>), which is a third-party lab report we provide for every product we sell. This report will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any toxins. At CBDfx, your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you’re looking for a pure CBD experience without any other active ingredients to cloud your cannabidiol calm, our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies are the perfect product for you! Packed with 25 mg of broad spectrum CBD per gummy (a whopping 50 mg per serving!), our natural, vegan, berry-flavored gummies are a delicious way to enjoy the calming wellness benefits of CBD!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The suggested serving size for our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies is two gummies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re new to CBD, we suggest that you try one gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. If your CBD gummy works, great! You’ve found your effective CBD serving size. If not, then wait until the next day to try a higher </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-dosage-how-much-should-i-take/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD dosage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Remember that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400">when you take CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> gummies and other edibles, it can take 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the effects, depending on personal </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">bioavailability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> factors, including height, weight, body mass, CBD tolerance, and other factors.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Benefits of Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and gummies are a match made in Heaven. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, of course, is the incredibly popular health supplement that engages the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and produces powerful calming wellness benefits for the mind and body. </span><b>Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> — like classic gummy bears — are one of the most popular candy treats on the planet. People love the burst of flavor that comes with these delicious chews. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides the flavor factor, there are other reasons that many </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> users prefer to enjoy their cannabidiol in gummy form. Gummies are easily portable and you can discreetly take them whenever and wherever you like. </span><b>CBD gummy bears</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> also allow you to know exactly how much CBD you’re taking in every serving. This is especially important for those new to CBD, who are learning how to find their own personal Goldilocks serving: the amount of CBD that’s just right for them. Because we all have different bioavailability (the rate and amount of CBD that we absorb), CBD can affect us all differently. Having a reliable serving size takes all the guesswork out of CBD dosage. Every one of our best-selling </span><b>CBD gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> contains 25 mg of broad spectrum CBD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies aren’t just for beginners. With 50 mg of CBD in every serving, our gummies give you a potent dose of the calming wellness that CBD users desire. And did we mention how incredibly delicious the natural berry flavoring is in these </span><b>broad spectrum CBD gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why Use Broad Spectrum CBD in CBD Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three types of CBD oil used in the various CBD products you’ll find online and in stores. When the CBD is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant, that unfiltered CBD oil is called full spectrum CBD. Full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids (including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and trace amounts of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and healthy fatty acids of the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although hemp, by law, must contain less than 0.3% THC content (which is likely not enough to get you high), many people still prefer to have those trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol removed. For one thing, this takes all the worry out of potentially having a false-positive result on a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/does-cbd-show-up-on-a-drug-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400">drug test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. But also, many folks just don’t want THC in their system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, a filtration process takes place that removes all detectable THC from the CBD oil. While this filtration process does remove a few of the other hemp compounds in the process, the resulting oil is still a robust and potent CBD oil, full of cannabinoids and other compounds. This CBD oil is called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. (Please note that even the tiniest traces of THC can build up over time in your system, potentially even with broad spectrum usage).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The benefit of these two kinds of CBD is that they allow you to experience the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. This is the phenomenon in which CBD and other hemp compounds don’t merely work in parallel with one another when consumed together; but instead, the various cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually enhance each other’s effects, making them work harder for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a third type of CBD, as well, which is called CBD isolate. The isolate form of CBD has all other hemp matter removed, except for the CBD, and is 99% pure CBD. This flavorless and scent-free version of CBD does work well with some bath products and CBD vape juices. But it does not provide the Entourage Effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We prefer </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for our CBD gummies because it gives you the benefit of the Entourage Effect and a wide variety of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids to enhance your experience — with detectable levels of THC filtered out. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Other Natural Ingredients in Our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our Original Mixed Berry CBD Gummies contain no corn syrup, artificial colors or sweeteners, or animal-based ingredients. What these delicious gummies do contain is organic tapioca syrup and cane sugar (only 1 gram), pectin, tri sodium citrate, citric acid, tomato lycopene (for color), and natural flavoring. With our CBD gummies, you can rest assured that you’re enjoying an all-natural, vegan CBD experience!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Why Are CBDfx Gummies the Best CBD Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, we insist on purity and potency in all of our CBD products. Every product we sell is made with organically sourced hemp, with the CBD oil extracted by means of clean CO2.

Remember that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400">when you take CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> edibles, it can take 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the effects, depending on personal </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">bioavailability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> factors, including height, weight, CBD tolerance, and other factors.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">The Benefits of CBD Gummies for Sleep</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies for Sleep</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> are an effective natural </span><b>sleep aid</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, formulated to tackle insomnia and give you a full night’s rest. With organic </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, melatonin and all-natural ingredients, these delicious hemp gummies are a safe, effective and natural alternative to traditional sleeping pills, which can potentially become habitual and can leave you with an unpleasant hangover feeling in the morning. With </span><b>CBD Sleep Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, you’ll awaken refreshed, renewed, and ready to take on your day!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Sleep begin with organic broad spectrum CBD. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cannabidiol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) has many healthful properties due to its interaction with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The endocannabinoid system helps to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in various systems and organs throughout the body, including the nervous system and brain. This helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as mood, memory, stress, immune, inflammation, appetite, pain, motor control and, yes, the body’s ability to regulate sleep cycles. It’s CBD’s interaction with receptors that control the sleep cycle that produces a feeling of gentle relaxation when you take CBD products. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-sleep-beating-insomnia-the-natural-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD for sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> can be an especially effective supplement, if blended with other natural sleep ingredients.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Using Melatonin With CBD</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain and released into the bloodstream to help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. People have taken over-the-counter melatonin supplements for decades to complement the body’s sometimes inadequate production of this restful hormone. Melatonin is an ideal supplement to combine with CBD, since both ingredients simply help the body do what it’s already doing — only more efficiently. Make sure not to drive or operate heavy machinery when taking a melatonin product, as melatonin may cause drowsiness.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">What Are Terpenes?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are phytocompounds that give plants their scent, and do everything from encouraging pollination to warning away pests. For humans, these compounds have often been found to have beneficial wellness effects. In fact, terpenes form the basis of many essential oils, and are used in holistic treatments, such as aromatherapy. Some terpenes, such as those found in lavender and yes, cannabis, have been found to relax the mind and body.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terpenes can also contribute to the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which is a term used to describe the phenomenon by which </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and other </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> compounds bolster each other’s effects when consumed together. This means the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in these vegan CBD gummies makes the sleep terpenes work harder for you and those very same terpenes make your calming CBD more effective, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Other Restful Ingredients</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our </span><b>CBD Gummies with Melatonin</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Sleep contain several restful ingredients to regulate sleep cycles and maximize your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-sleep-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> experience. Magnesium has been shown to help the mind and body unwind and relax. Likewise, the botanical extracts used in these gummies — from passion flower, lemon balm, and chamomile — also give a calming effect that helps to prepare the body for rest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With broad spectrum CBD, restful melatonin and magnesium, plus a potent blend of calming botanicals and sleep terpenes, our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-the-best-cbd-gummies-for-sleep/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD Gummies for Sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are a tasty way to send you off to Dreamland!</span></p>

<h3>What Is Apple Cider Vinegar Good For?</h3>
<p>Apple cider vinegar is an incredibly popular form of vinegar, which has been used for years in a countless number of home remedies. It is created by fermenting the sugar of apples and converting it to acetic acid, which is the main active ingredient in vinegar. Acetic acid has also been found to both eliminate and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, so drinking apple cider vinegar infused products could benefit your body greatly.</p>
<p>Organic apple cider vinegar is showing promise in studies that show a positive connection between the vinegar and healthy blood sugar levels. Additionally, since apple cider vinegar can make you feel full faster, it may also improve weight loss efforts.</p>
<h3>What Is The Apple Cider Vinegar Diet?</h3>
<p>The apple cider vinegar diet is a form of dietary restraint that revolves around the consumption of the aforementioned form of vinegar. It’s fairly vague, only requiring that you have a bit of the vinegar either with each meal or as an alternative to certain foods. Since a sense of fullness often comes with consuming apple cider vinegar, weight loss is all but guaranteed, since you won’t have to eat nearly as much to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Also referred to as an “apple cider vinegar detox,” adding this type of vinegar to your diet could help you get away from some of the foods that would otherwise hinder your weight loss journey. Whether you prefer to have some of apple cider vinegar before bed, or would rather purchase a bottle of apple cider vinegar capsules to have with you on the go, there’s an option for everyone!</p>
<h3>Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies With CBD!</h3>
<p>If you thought that apple cider vinegar products were good on their own, just wait until you try them with an additional 50mg serving of premium CBD hemp extract! CBD and apple cider vinegar are a match made in heaven, and when blended together properly, they create a gummy so perfect that you’ll never have to actually learn how to drink apple cider vinegar!</p>

<p>We all know we’re supposed to get a set amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients every day, but can you confidently say you’re getting what you need from your current routine?</p>
<p>If your natural diet isn’t cutting it, it may be time to infuse your days with a heaping helping of our Multivitamin Gummies. Developing a vitamin deficiency isn’t healthy, but maintaining proper nutrient levels can enhance more areas of your life than you know.</p>
<p>Thankfully, multivitamins combine a host of essential vitamins and nutrients, so you don’t have to worry about missing your recommended intake.</p>
<p>Feeling fatigued or “worn down” is one of the most common signs of vitamin deficiency, but symptoms can vary depending on which vitamins your body is lacking. This is why taking multivitamins is one of the best ways you can support better long-term health.</p>
<p>But let’s take a closer look at some of the specific signs of vitamin deficiency&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Signs That You&#8217;re Vitamin Deficient</h3>
<p>When you develop a vitamin deficiency, your body will react with specific signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>And without essential vitamins and nutrients, your body won’t grow and function naturally. As a result, you’ll feel “off” at times, fatigued, or downright sick.</p>
<p>Signs of a vitamin deficiency include…</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling Fatigued or “Worn Down”</li>
<li>Sensitive Gums That Bleed Easily</li>
<li>Brittle Hair and Nails</li>
<li>Muscle Pain or Stiffness</li>
<li>Difficulty Thinking Clearly</li>
<li>Feeling Cold All the Time</li>
<li>Mood Changes</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Vitamins Do You Need?</h3>
<p><strong>Vitamin A</strong><br />
Essential to preserving your vision—slowing age-related sight issues—Vitamin A also helps to sustain healthy immune function. It also helps you maintain your body’s natural defense to outside threats and speeds up recovery time when you’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong><br />
Although this vitamin supports many bodily functions, the body cannot produce it naturally. However, when absorbed from various fruits, vegetables, and our multivitamin gummies, Vitamin B12 can boost energy levels, improve memory, support bone health, and enhance your overall mood.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br />
Although our bodies can’t produce Vitamin C naturally, it’s extremely important for our overall health. Known to boost immunity, maintain and increase collagen production, reduce the risk of chronic disease, prevent iron deficiency, and enhance cognitive function, Vitamin C is essential to better health.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin D3</strong><br />
Known as the “sunshine” vitamin, Vitamin D is a nutrient specifically derived from the sun. Helping the body to absorb bone-strengthening calcium, Vitamin D also functions to boost immunity and enhance your overall mood.</p>
