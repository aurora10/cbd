										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Directions for Best Results</h2>
<p>One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy!</p>
<p>Please note that if you’re new to delta-9 THC, you should consider trying half a pumpkin gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to fully kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the pumpkin gummy.</p>
<h2>A Fall Classic — Now in THC Gummy Form!</h2>
<p>For many, fall just wouldn’t be complete without pumpkin spice. And now, for a limited time, you can enjoy that classic autumnal flavor in a high-potency THC gummy! Our Limited-Edition THC + CBD Gummies: Pumpkin Spice Sativa deliver a whopping 10mg of delta-9 THC per one-gummy serving, along with 30mg of CBD per serving — all in a mouth-watering pumpkin spice flavor you’re sure to love. These gummies are only available for a limited time, so grab a bottle today and get cozy — things are about to get spicy!</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies</h2>
<p>Each of our <strong>delta-9 THC</strong> products (including our Pumpkin Spice <strong>THC Gummies</strong>) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious edibles are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the health and wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) interacts with receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeostasis</a>, or balance, in several vital systems and organs. Most notably, this includes the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. The interaction between CBD and the ECS assists the various organs and systems in regulating several important functions, such as sleep, immunity, mood, memory, motor control, appetite, stress relief, pain processing, and more. This produces a wealth of health benefits and is the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Full spectrum CBD</strong> oil, which is the oil used in our <strong>Delta-9 THC Gummies</strong>, is particularly beneficial, as it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Delta-9 THC (<strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids can produce multiple benefits.</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>Cannabis connoisseurs tend to associate sativa strains with mood enhancement, feelings of exhilaration, and bursts of creativity. This uplifting feeling works wonderfully with the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> can have calming effects for the mind and for the body. Delta-9 THC also has deeply relaxing qualities, making this cannabinoid combo perfect for long, unwind-the-mind “chill” sessions.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>As noted, CBD interacts with receptors in the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several important organs and systems. THC also carries a host of health and wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, pain and stress relief, antioxidant and immunity benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the oil that’s initially extracted from the leaves, buds, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust extract includes health-boosting <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabis compounds are taken together, rather than simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is referred to as the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many people who use CBD prefer full spectrum CBD oil products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>) is the compound in cannabis that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana. That is to say, it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids, which means there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis. Delta-8 and delta-10 THC also have somewhat different effects than delta-9 THC.</p>
<p>While tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high if you take enough of it, delta-9 also has several health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, sleep support, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these limited-edition gummies) only contain THC that was derived from hemp. All of the products in this collection (and on this site) are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the US legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>As noted above on this page, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects via the phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. And in a product like our Pumpkin Spice THC Gummies, which feature 30mg of CBD and 10mg of THC per serving, that means your two major cannabinoids will work in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, delivering a deeper cannabinoid experience to you.</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis plants as, simply, sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have divided cannabis into three groups: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when consumed. The properties of sativa have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Pumpkin Spice Sativa Gummies are formulated to share these effects, but are compliant with legal THC limits.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD and THC product sold by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, delta-9 THC, and mushroom products (including high-potency Pumpkin Spice Delta-9 THC Gummies) is free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This oil has been extracted from the hemp by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as can happen with some cheaper oil extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC, and mushroom products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking lab reports</a>, which accompany every product on the CBDfx website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report, which is called a <strong>Certificate of Analysis</strong> (COA). COAs are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. They allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. Your safety and satisfaction are our top priorities!</p>
<p><em>Warning: This product may cause psychotropic effects.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[A good night’s sleep can be elusive. Our Sweet Dreams Drops help you get to sleep quickly and rest more soundly through the night. This powerful tincture combines full spectrum CBD with added CBN, the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid, sleep terpenes, and the maximum legal amount of delta-9 THC.

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong> Shake well before use. Place one full dropper (1mL) under the tongue and hold for one minute before swallowing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Delta-9 THC Oil Drops + CBN: Sweet Dreams Blend</h2>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">wellness benefits</a> that are a result of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system, <b>CBD</b> also has powerful <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">calming properties</a> — particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <b>cannabinoids</b>, terpenes, and flavonoids of the cannabis hemp plant. In terms of calming, nothing beats the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” CBN, which is a vital component of our sleep tincture. <b>THC</b> also delivers relaxation benefits, as well as wellness benefits and mood enhancement. Together, these cannabinoids make a powerful (and natural) alternative to prescription sleeping pills and other drug store sleep aids.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> oil has a wonderful calming effect on the mind and body. CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” takes that calming effect to the next level with deep, restful properties. Delta-9 THC and sleep terpenes also help the mind and body to unwind before bed.</p>
<h3>Deeper Sleep</h3>
<p>Every ingredient in these delta-9 sleep drops is formulated to not only help you fall asleep, but to also sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions.</p>
<h3>No “Hangover”</h3>
<p>With most sleeping pills, you can wake up in the morning feeling groggy and just plain lousy. With our THC sleep oil, there are no ill after-effects. You wake up feeling refreshed and renewed.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>When CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, it helps the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in several crucial systems and organs. THC also has several wellness benefits, which include stress and pain relief, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the CBD oil that is initially extracted from the buds, leaves and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the healthful compounds of the hemp plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. Among the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> found in full spectrum CBD are CBD (of course), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are other THC cannabinoids (such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC), delta-9 is the version of THC that is most associated with the intoxicating effects of marijuana. The full name of delta-9 is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, in large enough quantities, this THC compound can get you high. But <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> also has several wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend is derived from the hemp plant (not marijuana) and adheres to legal THC thresholds required in the United States.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best THC Oil?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a CBD product with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">the CBDfx label</a>, you can rest assured that you’re getting a quality product. Our CBD is derived exclusively from cannabis hemp plants organically grown at our state-of-the-art US partner farms (in the great state of Kentucky!), and extracted with clean CO2. All of our CBD products — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops — are tested by an independent, third-party laboratory and test results are made available to all visitors on our website.</p>
<h2>How Can I Tell If My THC Sleep Oil Is Organic?</h2>
<p>If you’re shopping for CBD, CBN, or THC products, always look for a lab report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. Every reputable CBD brand will provide independent lab reports for all of their products. At CBDfx, we believe in transparency and happily provide <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">a third-party lab report</a> for every CBD and delta-9 product we sell. This means that you can verify the potency of your CBN + THC oil and rest assured that it contains no harmful contaminants!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take To Feel the Effects of a CBD Tincture?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">When CBD or THC oil is taken sublingually</a> — that is, absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries under the tongue — the effects are felt much more quickly than they are when you simply swallow the oil. If you simply swallow your tincture oil, the CBD, CBN and THC have to travel through your digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream. If you take your CBD oil sublingually, you may feel the effects as quickly as 15 minutes, depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, tolerance, and metabolism.</p>
<h2>Where Does the CBD in CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend Come From?</h2>
<p>All of our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> is grown in the United States — in Kentucky, a state with a long, successful history in cannabis hemp farming. All of our cannabis hemp plants are subject to the strict standards of the United States Government.</p>

<h3>Cultivation</h3>

<h3>All-Natural Ingredients</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the highly purified, organic CBD oil has been extracted from our hemp plants, we combine it with other natural ingredients — all quality assured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>

See how full spectrum CBD oil compares to other types of CBD.<br />

<h2>Sweet Dreams Are Made of This: Delta-9 THC Drops + CBN</h2>
<p>Our Delta 9 Sweet Dreams oil drops are the finest in natural sleep supplements. Featuring organic full spectrum CBD, CBN (the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid), delta-9 THC, and sleep terpenes, this tincture is formulated to not only get you to sleep quickly, but to help you sleep soundly through the night, with fewer interruptions. Our delta-9 sleep tincture gives you all of these sleep benefits without the morning hangover that comes with many sleeping pills. Enjoy your best sleep ever with these special full spectrum Delta-9 Drops, available in strengths of 1500 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, 3000 mg CBD/67.5 mg THC, and 6000 mg CBD/135 mg THC.</p>
<h2>The Power of Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>The powerful ingredient profile of our CBN + Delta-9 THC Drops: Sweet Dreams Blend begins with full spectrum CBD. As we mentioned above, the term “full spectrum CBD” refers to CBD oil as it was directly extracted from the hemp plant, with no cannabis materials filtered out. This means full spectrum oil contains all of the cannabinoids of the cannabis hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and less than 0.3% THC. Full spectrum CBD oil also contains a robust profile of terpenes and flavonoids.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/">Entourage Effect</a> is the term used to describe the phenomenon in which the various compounds of the hemp plant — all of the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids — don’t merely work in parallel with one another as they interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Instead, CBD, CBN, THC, and the rest of the compounds actually bolster each other’s effectiveness. So, in a CBD product containing full spectrum oil (such as our CBN oil for sleep), your CBD actually works harder for you than it would if taken alone.</p>
<h3>The Role of THC in Our Full Spectrum Sleep Oil</h3>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% THC, by law). This is not enough THC to be intoxicating to the user. As we’ve noted above, those trace amounts of THC actually have many wellness benefits, including sleep, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. Like other cannabinoids, THC contributes to the Entourage Effect that makes your CBD work harder for you. So, yes, delta-9 can have intoxicating properties if you take a high enough dosage, but delta-9 can also provide you with a wealth of wellness benefits — and it has many restful properties that make it the perfect ingredient for a natural CBD sleep oil.</p>
<p>What we’ve done with our delta-9 line of products is to maximize the wellness potential of THC. With the US legal threshold of THC content set at 0.3% THC in dry weight hemp, we’ve gone into our oil extract after the THC has been measured and increased the amount of THC so that it’s much closer to the legal limit. The resulting delta-9 product — including our CBN + Delta-9 THC Sleep Drops is still legally compliant, but allows you to enjoy the most THC wellness benefits possible!</p>
<h2>CBN: The Ultimate Relaxation Cannabinoid</h2>
<p>Cannabinol, better known as CBN, is one of the most famous and important of the so-called “minor” cannabinoids. CBN is a metabolite of THC, meaning that it is formed when the composition of THC is altered by heat or light. While CBN doesn’t retain the intoxicating properties of THC, it does carry over the relaxation qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol to such an extent that CBN is commonly referred to as “the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.”</p>
<h2>The Final Word on Full Spectrum CBD + CBN + THC for Sleep</h2>
<p>Each of our delta-9 products (including our sleep tincture and chill tincture) is formulated with your health in mind. At CBDfx, our goal is to give you the best CBD experience possible and to help you on your journey to better living. Our full spectrum sleep oil can help you get a better night’s sleep, which is vital for good health. We wish you all the best on your wellness journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">CBD + CBN Oil Calming Tincture</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A New Take on Our Classic CBD Tincture Oils:</p>
<p>Welcome to the state of calm with our CBN + CBD Oil Tincture.</p>
<p>Taking what you loved about our classic <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/">CBD Tinctures</a>, we’ve updated them to enhance their flavor (now delightfully herbaceous <span style="font-weight: 400;">with no “hempy” after taste</span>) while adding CBN! From Classic to Calming, our latest tincture iteration marks a new step forward for an old favorite!</p>
<p>With more than 27% of Americans suffering from some form of sleep disorder, it’s no surprise that getting a good night’s sleep has become harder than ever. Not only does a lack of sleep leave us tired and groggy the following day, but it’s also incredibly detrimental to our health.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownies</h2>
<p>CBD is well known for its abundant calming and wellness-boosting benefits, particularly in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the hemp plant. <strong>THC</strong> (tetrahydrocannabinol) also delivers a wealth of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and mood enhancement. Together, these two potent cannabinoids make a perfect choice for those looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a>’s best-known benefits is a gentle calming effect that relaxes the mind and the body. This effect is especially notable in full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including cannabinol (or CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid”). Delta-9 THC raises the “chill” factor even more with additional restful effects.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because of the relaxation properties of full spectrum CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, this edible is also great for easing nervous tension and stress, which can lead to anxiety for some people.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most pronounced effects of delta-9 THC is mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Brownie Bliss is formulated to deliver a gently elevated peace of mind, plus bursts of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping the body to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC has several health and wellness benefits, as well, including stress and pain relief, immune benefits, antioxidant effects, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially derived from the buds (flower), leaves, and stalks of the cannabis <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>. Full spectrum CBD contains all of the chemical compounds of the plant, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, and flavonoids. In addition to CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other cannabinoids</a>, full spectrum CBD also contains small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there are minor cannabinoids with “delta” in their names, such as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, delta-9 is the type of THC that is the psychoactive compound most associated with marijuana. Delta-9 THC’s full name is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> and, yes, this THC compound can get you high if you take it in large enough quantities. But delta-9 also has a great number of health and wellness benefits, including everything from pain and stress management to muscle relaxation to mood elevation. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Brownie Bliss is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, it takes a little longer to feel the effects than it would if you used a vape product or sublingual oil. When you swallow your brownie edible, CBD, THC, and the rest of the cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before being absorbed into the bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, and metabolism, as well as other factors, including the amount of CBD or THC in your product. The benefit of THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>THC Bliss + Brownie Goodness</h2>
<p>Every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. It is our goal to provide you with the very highest quality in every CBD product you buy — both in purity and potency. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 brownie, and we wish you the very best on your journey to wellness.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> (cannabidiol) is well known for its calming wellness benefits. Full spectrum CBD, containing all of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cannabinoids</strong></a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and health fatty acids of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp plant</a>, is the most robust of all CBD oils and delivers the most powerful CBD experience. <strong>THC</strong> (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong></a>) also delivers a bevy of wellness benefits, plus powerful relaxation and blissful mood enhancement. Together, these two cannabinoids make an ideal choice for people looking to “chill” the natural way.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Among CBD’s best-known effects are its gentle calming properties that relax the mind and the body. This is especially notable when you take full spectrum CBD, which contains all of the cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBN, the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid.” <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a> raises the relaxation factor with additional “chill” properties.</p>
<h3>Stress Relief</h3>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD and delta-9 THC both deliver strong relaxation effects, this edible product works great for easing stress and nervous tension, which can lead to anxiety for some people, if left unchecked.</p>
<h3>Mood Enhancement</h3>
<p>One of the most notable effects of delta-9 THC is epic mood elevation. Our CBD + THC Chocolate Chip Cookie is formulated to deliver a blissful peace of mind, plus waves of inspired creativity.</p>
<h3>Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with receptors in the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping to maintain homeostasis (balance) in many important systems and organs. THC also delivers many health and wellness benefits, including stress and pain relief, antioxidant effects, immune benefits, and more.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the most robust of all types of CBD oil. It is the unfiltered oil extract as it is initially derived from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves, and stalks. Full spectrum oil contains all of hemp’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. This includes such notable compounds as CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (less than 0.3% THC, by US law).</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p>While there is such a thing as delta-8 THC and delta-10 THC, these are considered “minor cannabinoids,” meaning they only occur in the tiniest quantities in cannabis. Delta-9 THC, on the other hand, is a major cannabinoid and is the psychoactive compound most associated with cannabis. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the compound that is known for getting you high if you take enough of it (as with marijuana). But delta-9 THC also has a number of health and wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, muscle relaxation, mood elevation, and more. The delta-9 THC we use in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Cookies is derived from hemp and adheres to all US legal THC thresholds.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Edible?</h2>
<p>It takes a bit longer to feel the effects <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when you take a CBD or THC edible</a>, compared to a vape product or sublingual oil. This is because, when you swallow your cookie, the CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids have to travel through your digestive tract before they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on personal bioavailability factors, such as height, weight, body mass, tolerance, and metabolism, as well as the amount of CBD or THC in your edible product. The benefit of taking THC or CBD edibles is that their effects last much longer than other products, potentially six to eight hours!</p>
<h2>Our Most Potent Cookie Ever!</h2>
<p>Our Delta-9 THC Chocolate Chip Cookie delivers 20mg each of full spectrum CBD and THC. This gives you two full servings of delta-9 bliss in every one of these delectable edibles. As with every product in our Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection, this cookie is formulated with your health and wellness in mind. We hope you enjoy your delta-9 cookie, and we wish you the very best on your wellness journey.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our OG Kush Indica Vape Juice is designed to give you all the relaxing properties of a good cannabis indica, but with legally compliant levels of delta-9 THC. The restful THC properties of this delicious vape e-liquid are delightfully complemented with the calming wellness effects of full spectrum CBD, evoking relaxed memories of this classic cannabis strain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: OG Kush Indica</h2>
<p>Our <strong>CBD + Delta-9 THC OG Kush Indica Vape Juice</strong> delivers powerful relaxation effects for the mind and body. Capturing the deeply calming aspects of the legendary cannabis strain OG Kush, this <strong>THC e-liquid</strong> gives you the distinct flavor and “chill” of a classic indica, but within the legal THC limits set forth by the 2018 Farm Bill. The addition of full spectrum CBD takes those effects to the next level. And with a <strong>THC vape juice</strong> product, you can feel these benefits almost immediately!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of CBD</a> (cannabidiol) for the body and mind have made it an incredibly popular wellness supplement. These effects are the result of CBD’s interaction with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially notable with full spectrum CBD oil, which contains the full array of hemp’s health-boosting compounds, including all <strong>cannabinoids</strong>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/"><strong>Delta-9 THC</strong></a> (tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes greatly to both the health and wellness benefits associated with the endocannabinoid system, and also delivers deep, blissful relaxation. Taken together, these cannabinoids make a potent combination to help you get the rest and sweet “chill” you desire.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the initial oil extract culled from the hemp plant’s buds, leaves and stems. This robust CBD oil contains all of the wellness-boosting chemical compounds of cannabis hemp, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. Hemp contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 different cannabinoids</a>, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, and non-intoxicating trace amounts of delta-9 <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%).</p>
<p>While hemp can legally contain up to 0.3% THC in the US, full spectrum CBD can sometimes have THC content well below that legal threshold. Knowing that many people seek the full legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products. With these delta-9 products (including our OG Kush <strong>THC vape oil</strong>), we’ve added bonus THC to the full spectrum CBD oil to give you maximum legal delta-9 THC effects.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* is one of two major cannabinoids (the other being CBD) produced by the cannabis plant. This cannabinoid is different from delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC, which are minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9. Delta-9 THC does produce psychotropic effects, and if you take it in large enough quantities, tetrahydrocannabinol can definitely get you high.</p>
<p>But delta-9 THC also produces several health and wellness benefits, including mood elevation, sleep support, muscle relaxation, stress and pain management, and more. The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delta-9 THC</a>* we use in our <strong>THC vape juices</strong> is derived from hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill. This <strong>THC e liquid</strong> is not a marijuana product.</p>
<h2>What Is Indica?</h2>
<p>Some folks in the scientific community classify all forms of cannabis, including indica and ruderalis, as sativa. Others disagree and consider sativa, ruderalis, and indica to be three distinct species. Cannabis enthusiasts, though, have traditionally separated these cannabis types based on leaf shape and the effects they generate when consumed. Generally speaking, cannabis indica produces relaxation benefits for the mind and body, as well as powerful sleep benefits. Our CBD + THC OG Kush Vape Juice is formulated to deliver these benefits, while still legally compliant with the US 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx Delta-9 THC Vape Juice the Best You Can Buy?</h2>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Pineapple Express Hybrid Vape Juice is formulated to give you the uplifting vibes of a good sativa combined with the deep relaxation of an indica — all within the legal limits for delta-9 THC! Along with the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD, it’s the perfect vape juice for a long, chill afternoon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of CBD + Delta-9 THC Vape Juice: Pineapple Express &#8211; Hybrid</h2>
<p><strong>Delta-9 THC Pineapple Express Vape Juice</strong> is an ideal blend of good vibes and gentle relaxation. Combining the mood elevation of a sativa with the deep chill feel of an indica, this hybrid <strong>THC vape liquid</strong> gives you a wonderfully balanced delta-9 THC vape experience, within the legal limits set forth by the 2018 US Farm Bill. When you vape with this potent <strong>THC e-liquid</strong>, you can feel the effects of the cannabinoids almost immediately and enjoy one of the most popular (and famous!) cannabis flavor profiles around. In addition, you also get all the calming wellness benefits of full spectrum CBD!</p>
<p><strong>CBD</strong> (or cannabidiol) is renowned for the many <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> it delivers to the body and mind as a result of its interaction with the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a>. This is especially true of full spectrum CBD, which is the term used for the initial extract culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of cannabis hemp, containing all of hemp’s <strong>cannabinoids</strong> (including CBD and THC), terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids.</p>
<p>Like CBD, <strong>THC</strong> (or tetrahydrocannabinol) contributes positively to the wellness benefits associated with the ECS, plus it can also add mood enhancement and relaxation. It’s this combination of blissful benefits that’s particularly notable in cannabis hybrid strains, such as the famous Pineapple Express.</p>
<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>As noted, full spectrum CBD oil is the extract that is initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stems of the hemp plant. This robust oil contains all of the hemp plant’s health-boosting chemical compounds, including all <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terpenes</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flavonoids</a>, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in hemp, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a>, and small, non-intoxicating levels of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> (less than 0.3%, by law).</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD can sometimes produce THC amounts well below the legal limit, however. Understanding that many customers seek the maximum legal benefits of THC, we’ve created this Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC collection of products. With our Delta-9 THC line, we’ve added extra delta-9 THC to full spectrum CBD to give you maximum THC effects allowed by law.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* (tetrahydrocannabinol) is one of two major cannabinoid compounds produced by the cannabis plant. Delta-9 should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, both of which are considered minor cannabinoids and have slightly different properties than delta-9 THC. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta-9 THC</a>* does have psychotropic effects and if you take it in large enough quantities, delta-9 can get you high.</p>
<p>But THC also has many health and wellness benefits, including sleep support, mood elevation, stress and pain management, muscle relaxation, and more. The tetrahydrocannabinol we use in our <strong>THC Vape Juices</strong> is not derived from marijuana, but is instead derived from cannabis hemp and is legally compliant under the 2018 Farm Bill.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hybrid Cannabis Strain?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, cannabis enthusiasts have classified the different types of cannabis based on the plant’s leaf shape and the effects it delivers for the user. In general, the effects of a cannabis sativa strain are considered to include mood elevation, creativity, and reduction in stress and anxiety. Cannabis indica strains are most known for their deep relaxation effects. Hybrid cannabis strains are created when growers mix a sativa with an indica (there are cannabis ruderalis hybrids as well, but mostly, hybrids refer to a combination of sativa and indica). Hybrids can deliver the most pleasing aspects of both cannabis types, which is why strains like Pineapple Express are so popular with cannabis users.</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Vape?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vaping THC</strong></a>, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds is the quickest way to experience their effects. This is because the various cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lining of your lungs, which occurs much faster than if you were to take a CBD edible or sublingual CBD oil. When you <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-vaping-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vape THC or CBD</a>, you can feel the effects in just a few minutes (sometimes even seconds), depending on bioavailability factors, such as weight, height, body mass, CBD or THC tolerance, metabolism, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Why Is CBDfx THC Vape Juice the Best THC E-Liquid You Can Buy?</h2>

<strong>Directions for best results:</strong>

<strong>One gummy is a serving, but if this is your first time trying a delta-9 gummy start with a low dose (cut the gummy into pieces to make a desired dose). WAIT at least one hour to feel effects before consuming more. DO NOT take if driving, operating heavy machinery or if alertness is needed.</strong>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directions for Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One gummy per serving. Simply eat and enjoy! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, however, that if you’re new to <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, you should consider trying half a gummy for your first serving to see how it affects you. Remember that edibles can take 30 minutes to two hours to kick in, depending on personal bioavailability factors. So be patient and let some time pass before you decide whether or not to eat the other half of the gummy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Delta-9 THC + CBD Sativa Gummies </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our </span><b>delta-9 THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products (including our Magic Melon </span><b>THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is formulated with your enjoyment and wellness in mind. These delicious </span><b>sativa gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to give you the mood elevation and creativity of a good sativa strain, plus all the wellness benefits of CBD, THC, and other hemp-derived cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabidiol, or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for short, interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping the body to maintain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeostasis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (balance) in several vital systems and organs, including the central and peripheral nervous systems and the brain. This interaction between CBD and the ECS helps the various systems and organs to regulate important functions such as sleep, memory, motor control, immune, mood, appetite, stress and pain management, and more. These beneficial effects are the main reason CBD has become such a popular wellness supplement. </span></p>
<p><b>Full spectrum CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil, the oil used in our </span><b>Delta-9 THC Gummies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the active chemical compounds of the hemp plant, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids. </span><b>Tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (delta-9 THC) has a bevy of wellness benefits as well, plus deep and blissful relaxation effects. Taken together, these cannabinoids produce multiple benefits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood Elevation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis connoisseurs generally associate sativa strains with feelings of exhilaration, mood enhancement, and creativity. This uplifting feeling provides a wonderful complement to the gentle calming properties of cannabidiol.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relaxation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oil can have calming effects for the mind and body. Delta-9 THC also has deep restful qualities, making this cannabinoid combination ideal for long, relaxed “chill” sessions.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall Wellness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, CBD interacts with receptors in the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in several of its most important systems and organs. Tetrahydrocannabinol also carries a host of wellness benefits, including deep sleep support, soothing relief for pain and stress, antioxidant and immune benefits, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full spectrum CBD is the extract initially culled from the buds, leaves, and stalks of the cannabis hemp plant. This robust oil extract includes wellness-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, terpenes, flavonoids, and fatty acids. There are </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 100 cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full spectrum CBD, including CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and tiny traces of THC (less than 0.3%, by US law).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CBD and other cannabis compounds are consumed together, instead of simply working in parallel with one another, the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids actually bolster each other’s effects. This is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s the reason many CBD users prefer the power of full spectrum CBD oil products!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tetrahydrocannabinol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is the cannabis compound that is generally associated with the psychotropic effects of marijuana (it’s the cannabinoid that gets you high). Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 or delta-10 THC, which are considered minor cannabinoids (meaning there are only the tiniest traces of them in cannabis). Delta-8 and delta-10 THC have somewhat different effects than the major cannabinoid, delta-9 THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While delta-9 THC can definitely get you high if you take it in large enough amounts, it also has several wellness benefits, including pain and stress management, sleep support, mood elevation, muscle relaxation, and more. Our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) only contain THC derived from hemp. All of these products are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill and are below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted above, multiple cannabinoids can work together to boost each other’s effects (via the Entourage Effect). And in a product featuring 30mg of CBD per serving, along with 10mg of THC, that means your two major cannabinoids will be working in tandem to bolster one another’s effects, giving you a deeper cannabinoid experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Sativa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are scientists who classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, however, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three categories: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This classification is largely based on leaf shape and the effects the plant creates when you consume it. Sativa effects have mostly been observed to be mood elevation, creativity/inspiration, and reduced anxiety. Our Magic Melon Sativa is formulated to share these effects, but is still compliant with legal THC limits. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Best Delta-9 THC Gummies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every product </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold by CBDfx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is made with organic hemp oil. This means every one of our CBD, THC and mushroom products (including high-potency delta-9 THC gummies) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD hemp oil has been extracted by means of pure CO2, which doesn’t leave behind chemical solvent residues as with some cheaper extraction methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can verify the purity of our CBD, THC and mushroom products by </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking lab reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which accompany every product on our website. Any reputable CBD brand will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by non-biased, independent, third-party laboratories, so that you can trust their accuracy. These reports allow you to verify that our products are as pure and potent as we promise them to be. You can “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Benefits of Our Delta 9 THC Gummies + CBD &#8211; Sativa</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a>, or cannabidiol, interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, helping to maintain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">homeostasis</a> (balance) in several crucial systems and organs, including the nervous system and the brain. This interaction between CBD and the ECS helps to regulate such functions as sleep, memory, motor control, mood, appetite, pain and stress management, and more. These beneficial effects are what have made CBD such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>Full spectrum CBD, the CBD oil used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC Gummies, is especially beneficial, because it contains all of the hemp plant’s cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and healthy fatty acids. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has a host of wellness benefits too, plus blissful relaxation effects.</p>
<h3>Mood Elevation</h3>
<p>People largely associate cannabis sativa strains with feelings of exhilaration and mood enhancement. This peaceful, uplifting feeling is the perfect complement to the gentle calming properties of CBD.</p>
<h3>Relaxation</h3>
<p>Full spectrum <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> can have a peaceful calming effect on the mind and on the body. Delta-9 THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) also has a restful quality, making the CBD + THC combination perfect for a relaxed “chill” session.</p>
<h3>Overall Wellness</h3>
<p>CBD interacts with the body’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, helping it to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in several of its most crucial systems and organs.

<h2>What Is Full Spectrum CBD?</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD is the oil that is initially extracted from the cannabis hemp plant and contains all of the chemical content of the hemp buds, leaves, and stalks. This content includes wellness-rich <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids. There are <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">over 100 cannabinoids</a> in full spectrum CBD oil, including CBD, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/">CBG</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/">CBC</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/">CBN</a>, and trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by US law).</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum CBD and the Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>When CBD and other cannabinoids are consumed together, instead of merely working in parallel with one another, these compounds actually bolster each other’s effects. This phenomenon is called the Entourage Effect, and it’s a major reason why many CBD customers prefer the robust cannabinoid profile of full spectrum CBD products!</p>
<h2>What Is Delta-9 THC Gummies?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/delta-9-thc/">Delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>, is the cannabinoid generally associated with the intoxicating, or psychoactive, effects of marijuana. That is to say, delta-9 THC is the one that gets you high. Delta-9 THC should not be confused with delta-8 THC or delta-10 THC. These are considered minor cannabinoids and have somewhat different effects than delta-9. While delta-9 THC can certainly get you high if you take enough of it, it also has several wellness benefits, including mood elevation, muscle relaxation, pain and stress management, sleep support, and more. All THC used in our CBD + Delta-9 THC products (including these tasty gummies) is derived from hemp, and falls below the legal threshold of 0.3% THC.</p>
<h3>Delta-9 THC and the CBD Entourage Effect</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed how multiple cannabinoids work together to actually bolster each other’s effects (the Entourage Effect). Don’t forget that THC is also a cannabinoid and, as such, delta-9 can work to boost the effects of your CBD — and vice versa!</p>
<h2>What Is Sativa?</h2>
<p>Some scientists classify all cannabis as sativa. Traditionally, though, cannabis users have separated cannabis into three types: cannabis sativa, cannabis indica, and cannabis ruderalis. This separation is generally based on leaf shape and the effects the plant generates when you consume it. The effects of cannabis sativa have generally been observed to be mood elevation (hence the term, getting “high”), inspiration/creativity, and anxiety reduction. Our Berry Buzz Sativa blend is formulated to share these benefits, but within the THC limits established under US law.</p>
<h2>What Are the Best THC Gummies?</h2>
<p>Every CBD, THC, and mushroom product <a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-reasons-cbdfx-products-are-safe/">sold by CBDfx</a> is made using organic hemp oil. This means that all of our CBD products (including this full spectrum high potency delta-9 THC gummy) are free from pesticides, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful chemicals. This CBD oil has been extracted by means of clean CO2, which does not leave behind residual chemical solvent as is the case with some cheaper extraction methods.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity of our CBD, mushroom, and delta-9 THC products by <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">checking lab reports</a>, which we provide for every product on our website. All of the best CBD brands will provide you with such a report. These lab reports are made by independent, third-party laboratories, so you can trust their accuracy. These lab reports allow you to verify that our CBD, mushroom, and THC products are as potent as we promise them to be on our website and on the product label.</p>
<p>Because our CBD and THC products deliver in terms of both purity and potency, many longtime CBD users consider CBDfx to have the best CBD products, and consider our THC gummies to be the very <b>best THC gummies</b> you can buy. You can always “Feel the Difference” when you buy from CBDfx!</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take to Feel the Effects of a THC Gummy?</h2>
<p>CBD and delta-9 THC gummies are considered <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/">edibles</a>, which means that (yes) you eat them. This means the CBD and THC in your gummy product is absorbed into the bloodstream through your digestive system. Because of this, it takes longer to feel the effects of CBD edibles, such as CBD gummies or CBD cookies, than it does when you take a CBD or THC sublingual tincture or vape product. Depending on personal bioavailability factors (such as weight, height, metabolism, body mass, and tolerance), it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to feel the effects of a THC gummy.</p>
<p>On the plus side, edibles like our THC gummies stay in your bloodstream for a much longer period of time than CBD vapes and other forms of CBD and THC products. Sometimes you can feel the effects of a CBD edible for more than six hours, again depending on personal bioavailability factors and the strength of your delta-9 THC or CBD product.</p>
