										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you struggling to find the perfect gift for the athlete in your life? If so, you’ve landed on the right page! CBD makes an excellent gift for the athletes or workout warriors, especially if they’ve never tried it before! Come to find out, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-use-cbd-to-achieve-your-fitness-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding CBD to any pre- or post-workout routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or active sport makes a big difference in how fast your body recovers. But, of course, different sports call for different approaches, so let’s cover some of the most popular sports and workouts — and the CBD products best suited for that activity level. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Runners</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1965911" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg" alt="unwind mushroom,focus mushroom,mushroom tincture" width="244" height="265" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg 945w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-277x300.jpg 277w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-768x832.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-60x65.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-110x119.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-300x325.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021.jpg 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may not consider running a sport so much as it is a way of life. Still, some of the best athletes in the world hate running, for reasons most of us can relate to — your chest burns, and your legs tingle as the lactic acid builds. Overall, running is something you have to train your body to handle and excel at, so having </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-runners-benefit-from-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right CBD product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes this process much more manageable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent addition to a runner’s fitness routine because it contains an energizing yet relaxing blend of CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a match made in CBD heaven because CBG (“the mother of all cannabinoids”) is known to produce uplifting effects, while CBD gives calming mental focus and works to minimize muscle discomfort associated with running. Another effective pick-me-up for those early-morning runs is our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/">Focus Blend CBD Mushroom Tincture</a>, combining wellness-boosting CBD and energizing CBG, along with adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms, which serve to deliver energy, support immunity, and alleviate stress on the mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1804853 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-194x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle footcream mar " width="194" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-194x300.jpg 194w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-662x1024.jpg 662w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-768x1188.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-993x1536.jpg 993w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-1324x2048.jpg 1324w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-300x464.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-60x93.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-footcream-02-mar-30-2021-scaled.jpg 1655w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /></a>As one might imagine, runners deal with sore, tired, achy feet after running for hours on end when they train. So, if you’re shopping for a runner, consider adding our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Foot Cream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their stocking! This way, their feet can experience a calming, comforting retreat with 500mg of broad spectrum CBD paired with the natural, softening effects of shea butter and the detoxifying, therapeutic effects of aromatic lavender and tea tree oil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t mind training twice as hard when they know they have a product like this waiting in their gym bag!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Tennis Players</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennis is a full-body workout, running back and forth across the court while maintaining precise hand-eye coordination to hit the ball and immediately get back into position for your opponent’s next shot. All the while, you’re starting and stopping on a dime on a hard asphalt court!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2113034" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle.jpg" alt="cbdfx us bathbomb bundle" width="335" height="335" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-bathbomb-bundle-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a>Tennis can put incredible stress on the body — which is all the more reason the tennis player on your list will swoon over our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Bath Bombs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have two bath bombs to choose from: our Soothing CBD Bath Bomb with lavender and Hawaiian black salt and our Recharge CBD Bath Bomb with uplifting essential oils, like peppermint, eucalyptus, spearmint, and arnica to stimulate the senses and comfort aching muscles. And this year, we&#8217;ve added two new bath bombs to our collection: Hydrating Formula with mango and shea butter, and Calming Formula with chamomile and lemongrass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each formulation contains 200mg of CBD isolate, and they’re 100% organic and vegan. Not to mention, they don’t have any of those harsh chemical colorants that stain your tub!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Gym Rats</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason you see professional athletes </span><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a26788252/ice-bath-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">soaking in ice baths after an intense game</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These ice baths reduce inflammation and improve circulation. The right CBD product can give you much of the same benefits — if not more!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD topicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work well since they&#8217;re applied directly to the source of discomfort, and there’s plenty to choose from — CBD balms, lotions, bath soaks, and much more! These creams and lotions soak through the layers of skin and get right to the muscles and joints that are in need of soothing relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2148374" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle muscle joint group  aug  " width="299" height="413" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022.jpg 579w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-60x83.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-110x152.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-muscle-joint-group-05-aug-03-2022-300x415.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a>CBD Balm Sticks are always a great choice, because they&#8217;re effective and easy to use. We have two mess-free formulations: the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-muscle-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle and Joint CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both formulations have a generous concentration range from 750mg to 3000mg CBD for those who need a little more to get the job done!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Muscle and Joint Cream: Cooling Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural anti-inflammatories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/white-willow-bark-and-other-natural-pain-relievers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white willow bark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and caffeine, followed up with menthol for an immediate cooling sensation that soothes sore, tired muscles — without that soul-jolting ice bath!</span></p>
<p>Our new <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/">CBG Muscle and Joint Cream: Heating Formula</a> delivers many of the same anti-inflammatories, along with a healthy boost of CBG and muscle-warming camphor — perfect for deep tissue relief.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery Is the Gift That Keeps on Giving!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After practice, workout, or a game, the athlete on your list will want to come home and unwind with our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a full spectrum tincture that contains a blend of helpful cannabinoids (CBD and CBN, to be exact). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN is known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” perfect for when you want to come home, loosen up, and unwind. Some like to use it before bed, while others prefer adding it to their </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/create-a-cbd-self-care-routine-in-3-simple-steps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-care routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a chill Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1824931 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-297x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product tincture calming jun " width="297" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-297x300.jpg 297w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-1014x1024.jpg 1014w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-768x776.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-60x61.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-110x111.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-300x303.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-photo-product-tincture-calming-jun-22-2021.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a>Every athlete and workout warrior appreciates the need for rest and recovery, which makes our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-recovery-set-extra-strength/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Recovery Set</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such a perfect gift. This cost-saving bundle contains our best-selling CBD </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft Gel Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an uplifting yet soothing </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recharge Bath Bomb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a 1000mg </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Muscle and Joint Cream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This bundle has everything your athlete needs to fight muscle fatigue and maintain the stamina to keep playing at their best!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Yoga Lovers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While yoga isn’t technically a sport, it still wakes up muscles you haven’t used in quite some time. Yoga has picked up in popularity since the pandemic. People began to see the mental and physical benefits associated with stretching your muscles and calming your mind simultaneously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what kind of gift do you get for your yogi friends? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-turmeric-spirulina/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1897001 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-300x291.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle gummies womens mar " width="300" height="291" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-300x291.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-768x745.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-60x58.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202-110x107.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-02-mar-30-202.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We think they’ll enjoy our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-turmeric-spirulina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Gummies with Turmeric and Spirulina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they contain an abundance of wellness-boosting ingredients. Turmeric is one of the more well-known “superfood” ingredients that boasts some pretty impressive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It’s a great addition to any yogi’s fitness routine, because it reduces inflammation and discomfort within the joints, making it that much easier to transition into downward dog without your joints slowing the process. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wished to have things mentally click a little faster, to maintain focus a little longer, or actually remember things instead of immediately forgetting them? Most would say being able to improve brain health is a bit of … well, a no-brainer, right? And it’s probably one of the main reasons cognitive supplements are expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brain-health-supplements-market-size-worth-13-38-billion-by-2028-grand-view-research-inc-301214720.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13 billion in sales by 2028</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How so? Because everyone feels that need to improve focus, have a better memory, or simply sharpen their mental skills in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s no product that “makes you smarter,” there are supplements that can help boost cognitive function. These supplements are called </span><b>nootropics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and while they very well might be the perfect solution to a wandering mind, you should still do a bit of research before diving into this health supplement market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we will take an up-close look at nootropic supplements and two of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formulations with nootropic ingredients.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Do Nootropics Do? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1897054" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-300x262.jpg" alt="Nootropics" width="300" height="262" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-300x262.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-768x670.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-60x52.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics-110x96.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nootropics.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Brain supplements, like nootropics, are growing in popularity extremely quickly, because we all share a desire to be a little more &#8220;on point.” The name “nootropics” might sound a little technical or science-y, but you shouldn’t let that keep you from exploring their beneficial effects for the mind. In fact, it’s quite incredible what these </span><b>cognitive supplements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can potentially help you accomplish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at some of the </span><b>benefits of nootropics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitive Benefits</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, nootropics boost brain power, help regrow brain connections, and provide your brain with more oxygen, which basically equates to brain energy. Nootropics are also known as “smart supplements” or compounds that enhance cognitive function. Here are some of the benefits associated with nootropic supplements. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Improved memory</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Enhanced cognitive function</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Better </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-sleep-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sleep habits</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Boost focus and concentration </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Heighten brain energy </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Encourage neurogenesis, forming new neurons in the brain</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most intriguing part of nootropics is how they actually work. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Find Nootropics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we’re talking about something that can improve cognitive health, some people would say that caffeine is a nootropic. Stimulants like this give you a jolt of energy that helps wake the mind so you can power through the task in front of you. But what about the “real deal” nootropics — what are they, and where do you find them? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find two different types of nootropics: synthetic nootropics created in a lab and natural nootropics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adderall and Ritalin are two examples of prescription nootropics. But there are other nootropics that can be found in nature, like L-theanine, gingko, and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/facts-about-fungi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nootropic mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These “brain-boosting” </span><b>nootropic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplements can contribute to cognitive health in a number of ways. For example, L-theanine is an amino acid that pairs exceptionally well with caffeine, improving cognitive alertness. </span></p>
<p><b>Nootropic mushrooms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become particularly popular. While there are over 2,000 species of edible, health-boosting mushrooms, only six of mushroom species have nootropic effects — </span><b>chaga</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>cordyceps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>lion’s mane</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>maitake</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>reishi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and oyster mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do these </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nootropic mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work? Let’s have a look.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do Nootropics Work? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021479/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nootropics increase blood flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the brain, alongside an increase of nutrients, energy, and oxygen that provide the brain with extra “energy.” The neurons in the brain use this energy to boost focus, concentration, attention, and other beneficial effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your brain doesn’t have this extra energy, you may experience brain fog and mental fatigue, making it harder to focus on daily tasks or projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, nootropics may sound too good to be true, but there are </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021479/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies on nootropics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that validate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their effectiveness. This makes nootropics particularly intriguing when paired with </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-the-mental-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other wellness-boosting cannabinoids.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the Best CBD Nootropic Supplements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If boosting your brainpower while maintaining chill vibes and improving your wellness sounds like something you’d like to do, here are two CBD-infused nootropic supplements you’ll want to explore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And let us just clarify, you’re probably not going to be able to write a book in four days as Bradley Cooper did in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, when you use nootropic supplements consistently, you should begin to notice some cognitive effects that can enhance your day-to-day routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with L-theanine, the focus-enhancing amino acid found in green teas, black teas, and some mushrooms. L-Theanine can affect serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, resulting in a better mood, sleep, stress levels, and cognitive function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-shots-20mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Focus Shots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contain 20 mg of broad spectrum CBD and 200 mg of L-theanine. You can take this tasty pomegranate or tropical-flavored drink and power through your daily tasks or work projects with calm, focused tenacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These CBD “shots” are only two ounces, so you can toss them in your work or </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-the-gym-the-best-cbd-for-workouts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gym bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for easy access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you’re probably thinking: “What about nootropic mushrooms?”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1965909 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-863x1024.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="329" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-863x1024.jpg 863w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-253x300.jpg 253w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-768x911.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-60x71.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-110x131.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021-300x356.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushroom-soup-02-dec-29-2021.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushrooms + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the perfect addition to any daily health routine. Remember when we said there were six nootropic edible mushroom varieties? Well, this carefully crafted tincture contains three out of the six we mentioned: lion’s mane, chaga, and cordyceps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each mushroom plays a different role in this formulation. For example, lion’s mane dates back to ancient China, and has been used in teas by monks and other Buddhist traditionalists to boost brain power to help with focus during meditation. Lion’s mane stimulates enzyme production in the brain, which ultimately helps repair neurons in your brain and helps create pathways for new ones, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaga mushrooms grow on birch trees in northern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Northern Europe, and Korea. This nootropic mushroom has a solid health-boosting reputation, known to be an antiviral, antioxidant, and has even been studied for potential </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22135889/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-cancer effects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cordyceps mushroom has a long-standing fatigue-busting reputation. This powerful nootropic enhances blood flow, which boosts </span><a href="https://nootropicsexpert.com/nootropics-glossary/#adenosine-triphosphate-atp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> production for natural energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this extraordinary tincture has even more to offer with an accommodating blend of CBD and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the “Mother of All Cannabinoids” and an effective </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for producing the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-entourage-effect-and-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entourage Effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when used in combination with CBD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you’re probably wondering how to incorporate these superfood mushrooms into your daily health routine. Read on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Add Nootropics to Your Daily Routine</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1965911" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="294" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-945x1024.jpg 945w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-277x300.jpg 277w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-768x832.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-60x65.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-110x119.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021-300x325.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-02-dec-02-2021.jpg 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This probably goes without saying, but your morning routine is the most important routine of the day, because it can set a healthy tone for the entire day. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushrooms + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the perfect addition to any healthy morning regimen. One of the best things about this CBD and nootropic mushroom tincture is that you can enjoy it in a variety of ways. First, you can simply hold the tincture under your tongue for 60 seconds for quicker effects. Or, add a few drops to your morning smoothie for longer lasting effects. (Check out this helpful article for more information on </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-take-cbd-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioavailability and methods of CBD consumption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go the edible route, you can enjoy your nootropic mushroom and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-recipes-for-every-occasion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD oil with breakfast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or, really, in combination with any food or drink. Remember that CBD is fat-soluble, so taking it with a slice of avocado toast or a handful of nuts in the morning ensures the CBD and nootropic mushroom content absorbs quickly and efficiently — so your body can put all those good compounds to work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts on Nootropics </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we age, our minds can be a little less sharp than they used to be. Our memory slips and our overall cognitive function can decline. Nootropic supplements can help turn the tide on your cognitive performance and help you focus and be your best. And with added wellness-boosting CBD, these nootropic supplements make a perfect addition to any morning health routine!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s always a wellness buzzword trending these days, and right now, it’s </span><b>adaptogens</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And there’s no adaptogenic supplement trending hotter right now than mushrooms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before modern-day pharmaceutical medicine became common practice, we looked to nature for solutions and relief. Modern-day medicine has given us countless innovations, but some folks still prefer to keep things as natural as possible. So, let’s take a deep dive into adaptogens and explore how these plant-based </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/editors-pick-best-cbd-wellness-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness ingredients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help limit stress and anxiety while boosting cognitive function. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, What Can Adaptogens Do for Me? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know the feeling you get when life starts throwing all kinds of things your way: </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-simple-ways-to-relieve-work-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressing deadlines at work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fight with a close friend, sickness in your family, money troubles …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When “adulting” gets the best of you, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress builds up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly, and you begin to feel the unsavory effects of stress and anxiety. This is where adaptogens become pretty helpful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptogens are plant-based ingredients that help your body manage stress, or as some like to say — they help your body “adapt” to stressful times. Although adaptogens have grown in popularity with organic and holistic wellness practices, they go back to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-cbd-connects-to-the-worlds-greatest-civilizations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ancient Indian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ayurveda practices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptogens benefit the human body in a couple of ways: they help your body manage stress, keep the body at its natural state of homeostasis, encourage better cognitive health and function, fight harmful free radicals, and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how adaptogens work in a nutshell. When you feel stressed, your body goes into </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general adaptation syndrome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which has three parts — alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. Adaptogens help your body stay in the resistance phase longer, so your body doesn’t give in to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, instead of feeling hopeless or burning out, you have the mental energy to push through any pressing situation. Plus, stress activates the “fight or flight” response, which creates and releases cortisol in the body. But, too much cortisol brings unfavorable effects like anxiety, weight gain, digestive issues, and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-relationship-between-stress-and-sleep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insomnia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to name a few.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different adaptogenic herbs you can incorporate into your daily routine, but we’ve honed in on some we believe to be most beneficial — wellness mushrooms like reishi, lion’s mane, cordyceps, chaga, turkey tail, and maitake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn&#8217;t stop with mushrooms. There are </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/smart-girls-guide-to-adaptogens#how-to-use-adaptogens"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all kinds of adaptogenic ingredients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like ashwagandha, ginseng, eleuthero root, rhodiola rosea, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many find it hard to believe that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possess so much power, but it’s true! So, let’s take a closer look at some of these wellness mushrooms to see how they can bring adaptogenic benefits into your daily routine. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Adaptogenic Mushrooms</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we began researching </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicinal mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we couldn’t believe the benefits we were missing, especially combined with the soothing effects of CBD and other cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CBDfx, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-people-choose-cbdfx-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we take great pride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the amount of time and effort that goes into every formulation. That said, we conducted a lot of research on adaptogenic mushrooms and the positive effects they&#8217;re capable of providing. Let’s break down each adaptogenic wellness mushroom, so you have a greater understanding of the benefit they provide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240259/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that adaptogens can present a wide range of wellness benefits, but the research is still ongoing. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reishi Mushrooms</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1897068 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-150x150.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fungi-reishi-1.png 220w" sizes="(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px" />Reishi mushrooms, a.k.a. nature’s Xanax, have been a staple in Eastern medicine for quite some time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, guys and gals, we’re roughly one month into the new year, and some of us are still trying to create healthy new habits. And if you already have some </span><b>healthy habits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ve perfected, this just means it’s time to up the ante and take your </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/editors-pick-best-cbd-wellness-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health and wellness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the next level! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this doesn’t change how hard it is to hone in on realistic goals sometimes. Sure, you’d like to get up and fresh-press your own natural juice every morning. But then, life throws a bunch of things at you all at once — and BAM — there’s no time for at-home juicing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry! We’re going to shed some light on how you can simplify the process of creating healthy habits, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-cbd-can-help-your-work-life-balance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no matter how busy you get</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And we’ll show you how CBD can help you reach your goals!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Healthy Habits Are Important</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to compile bad habits in today’s world. Every day we’re introduced to things that can quickly morph into bad habits — </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-signs-you-need-a-digital-detox/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your new iPhone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the endless cool features, a new Netflix series with a cliffhanger ending each episode, or even that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-cbd-desserts-you-need-to-try/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cute little bakery</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that just opened down the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not saying you shouldn’t live life and enjoy these things, but instead, enjoy these things in moderation and place your main focus on things like exercise, trying new “</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-recipes-for-every-occasion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthy recipes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” journaling, or reading for at least five minutes a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy habit is anything that enhances your well-being, whether it’s physical, emotional, spiritual, or social. So, let’s take a closer look at some practices you can welcome into your daily or weekly routine. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Active</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1927794" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-240x300.jpg" alt="Get Active" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-768x960.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-60x75.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-110x138.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active-300x375.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Get-Active.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" />Millions of people struggle with this one — </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-top-5-products-for-an-active-lifestyle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting to the gym</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and getting enough exercise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Covid quarantines have made it extremely difficult for some people to maintain any fitness routine, since gyms were closed for such a long time. And even though gyms are open in some areas now, some don’t feel it’s safe enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This begs the question…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you stay active and avoid the couch? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not comfortable working out around others just yet, here are some things you can do to stay active. Did you know there are plenty of apps you can use for home workout! For example, the </span><a href="https://www.onepeloton.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peloton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app has tons of pre-recorded classes in various categories, like yoga, cardio, cycle, boot camp, and much more. They also have a full schedule of live classes you can join. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t be afraid to take it back to the basics, too. For example, try laying your yoga mat on the floor every morning for a combination workout —  a healthy morning habit with long-lasting effects you’ll feel all day. Start with some light stretching and deep breathing. Then, you can mix in some sit-ups, crunches, planks, or anything else that benefits your body or the areas you want to focus on.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1848688 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-238x300.jpg" alt="balmstick " width="238" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-238x300.jpg 238w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-813x1024.jpg 813w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-768x967.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-60x76.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-110x139.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-300x378.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /></a>Many find it to be a great addition to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/3-ways-to-use-cbd-with-yoga/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their sunrise yoga routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because it helps wake up stiff muscles in the early hours of the morning. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink More Water </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drinking water” is always on any “healthy habit” list, but there’s a good reason for this! You know the human body consists of </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-you-water-and-human-body"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but did you know water accounts for 75% of your brain mass? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means when you don’t get enough water, you might experience brain fog and mood swings. If you’re trying to drink more water every day, try carrying a water bottle with you. Believe it or not, you’ll drink more water than you usually would simply because you have it close at hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps to set daily water goals, even if you have your “on-the-go” water bottle. You can even find water bottles with hourly goal lines printed on the bottle to help keep you on track — how cool is that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re someone who doesn’t generally like drinking water, try adding cut fruit to your water. Orange, lemon, cucumber, and mint is a popular blend that many have come to love as a refreshing beverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, try playing with different fruit combinations to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cbd-drinks-is-cbd-water-soluble/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see what makes water more enjoyable </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for you if that’s holding you back.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start Your Day With Positive Vibes </span></h3>

Try starting the day with journaling combined with the energizing effects of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! This all-encompassing tincture contains powerful ingredients, like curcumin and coenzyme Q10, to keep you feeling motivated and ready for the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD alone has the tendency to be too relaxing in the beginning of the day, but this formulation contains a 2:1 ratio of CBD to </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, providing balanced, yet uplifting effects that you’ll love to start your day with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journaling is a great way to stay in touch with your needs and develop mindfulness that helps you make better decisions throughout the day — decisions that align with what you really want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes we make hasty decisions and wonder how we found ourselves down a certain road — journaling can help with this. It also helps reduce stress and anxiety, as some consider it a form of therapy, because you’re releasing negative or stagnant emotions that may possibly hold you back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journaling also helps you create and maintain goals, track progress, and improve self-confidence. It’s a helpful habit to shuffle into your self-care routine. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuel Your Body With Vitamins and Nutrients </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper nutrition plays a critical role in how you feel every day. However, it’s hard to keep up with what seems like a laundry list of vitamins and supplements, especially when it comes to remembering to take them! On the other hand, our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-mens-multivitamin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multivitamin CBD Gummies</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">make it easy to streamline your vitamin routine, because you’ll want to take these every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-mens-multivitamin/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1927800" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-275x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle gummies womens  mar  " width="275" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-275x300.jpg 275w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-768x838.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-60x66.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-110x120.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021-300x328.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-womens-01-mar-30-2021.jpg 916w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" /></a>You get the chill vibes of CBD combined with the wellness-boosting effects of our multivitamin blend, with hand-selected vitamin combinations formulated for both men and women!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tiny fraction of society receives proper nutrition from their diet, but this is where our Multivitamin CBD Gummies come into play. Each serving contains 50mg of broad spectrum CBD, alongside vitamins A, C, D3, E, &amp; B Complex (with added calcium and zinc in the women’s formula), helping you fill in the nutritional gaps!  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parting Thoughts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you set off on your journey to healthier living, one thing to remember is that everyone does things in their own time and in their own way. So, don’t stress about progress or your perceived lack thereof. Instead, if you feel like you need to do better, take a pause and write about it during your morning journaling session — and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/create-a-cbd-self-care-routine-in-3-simple-steps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make a plan to do better</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are all kinds of healthy habits, so it’s about finding and creating the ones that can make a meaningful difference in your life. How will you know when you’ve found them? Well, hopefully you’ll feel everything just start to “click.” But even if you’re not there yet, don’t lose hope and don’t stop. Every effort is a move in a positive direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what kind of healthy habits are you thinking about taking on for 2022? </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connoisseur, we&#8217;re guessing you were pretty excited to hear that certain cannabis compounds could possibly protect you from Covid-19 and two of the emerging variants. Since the onset of Covid, there’s been a lot of misinformation and confusion about how to protect yourself, but one thing doesn’t change — you have to keep your immune system healthy and strong!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study from Oregon State</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> describes how certain </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> latch onto the Covid-19 protein, creating spikes that prevent it from entering cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s explore this, along with other </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">things that boost immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you can stay in tip-top shape during these unpredictable times. But, first, let’s take a closer look at immunity, how it works, and why it’s important. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Immunity Works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your immune system works around the clock to protect your body from outside threats, like germs, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and more. So, when your body picks up on harmful, foreign substances (also known as antigens), the cells in your body work together to get rid of them. But, more importantly, they store information about how to get rid of that specific threat by creating antibodies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most common ways people boost immunity are exercise, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.co.uk/blogs/news/dealing-with-back-to-office-anxiety"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoiding stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, eating healthy foods, and taking supplements full of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd-multivitamins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immune-boosting vitamins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and nutrients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many CBD supplements that work to build immunity, but this new finding may have opened the door to something incredible. Let’s dive a little deeper into the recent study surrounding cannabinoids and Covid-19 to see how you can test this theory at home. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Cannabinoids Might Be Able to Help With Covid</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we’ve talked about how the immune system works and how certain cannabinoids create spikes on the Covid-19 protein, potentially blocking entry into the cell and preventing infection. So now the big question: Which cannabinoids made this possible during this study? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabinoid acids CBGA and CBDA are the two cannabinoids featured in the Oregon State study. These acidic forms of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CBD are well known in the CBD community, and they possess some incredible benefits.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1866142 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-161x300.jpg" alt="Wellness Texture" width="161" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-161x300.jpg 161w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-551x1024.jpg 551w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-60x112.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-110x204.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2-300x558.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Wellness-Texture2.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts with CBGA, or cannabigerolic acid. CBGA serves as a precursor for CBG (“the mother of all cannabinoids”) because as CBGA matures, it drops its carboxylic acid element and can become a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variety of other cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like CBG, CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cbd/what-is-cbda-cannabidiolic-acid-marijuana-cannabinoid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as mentioned, is the acidic precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). Unlike CBD, CBDA doesn’t bind directly to CB1 and CB2 receptors in the body. Instead, CBDA imparts its beneficial properties on the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14965321/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COX-2 enzyme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cyclooxygenase-2). These enzymes have been shown to relieve inflammation and pain, giving it great potential as an anti-inflammatory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at CBDfx, we saw the immense value in CBG and CBD early on, and that’s why the combination of the two has been a focus of many of our wellness products, including our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbg-morning-capsules-900mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Morning Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So let’s talk about things you can do to boost immunity, along with a couple of our favorite CBG-infused wellness products that have immunity-boosting ingredients. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat Plenty of Fruits, Veggies … and Mushrooms! </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbg-morning-capsules-900mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1844496 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-220x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle capsules morning jun " width="220" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-220x300.jpg 220w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-751x1024.jpg 751w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-768x1048.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-60x82.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-110x150.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-1126x1536.jpg 1126w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-1502x2048.jpg 1502w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-300x409.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-capsules-morning-jun-22-2021-scaled.jpg 1877w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /></a>It’s tempting to opt for fast food when you’re busy, or burnt out, or tired of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-recipes-for-every-occasion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cooking every day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  This just means you have to get a little creative! Besides, did you know eating fruits and veggies can increase your white blood cell count? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so back to “getting creative.” There are many ways to ensure you get the right amount of healthy foods in your system. Do you like salads? If so, try making a big salad on Sunday so you can just pop it in a Tupperware to take to work. Sure, we’re not reinventing the wheel, since we all know this process as meal prepping, but give it a try. It may work wonders for your eating habits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding fruit and veggie smoothies to your daily routine is another sure-fire way to improve your immune system. If you’re not a big breakfast person, try adding a smoothie to your routine. They’re great because not only do you get tons of fruits and veggies, but you can add other supplements that are virtually undetectable in the delicious drink you whipped up. </span></p>

This tincture combines a unique blend of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wellness-enhancing mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — chaga mushrooms to promote healthy immune function, lion’s mane to help reduce stress throughout the day, and cordyceps to help you move through your day without hitting an exhaustion wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and let’s not forget that our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushrooms + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains CBG — the cannabinoid </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new research suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might help you avoid Covid-19. This broad spectrum blend includes 2.5mg of CBG per serving, alongside the wellness-enhancing benefits of CBD! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimize Stress When Possible </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you’ve heard the whole “stop stressing, it’s bad for you” speech before, but it’s true! </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress affects your health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on several levels. But more specific to this conversation, stress reduces the number of active white cells you have when it comes to immunity. And if you remember, white blood cells are the ones fighting off bacteria, viruses, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has their own stress triggers, so it helps to know your triggers so you can hopefully avoid stress altogether. However, there will still be times you need a little assistance from your favorite cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your routine promotes calming vibes that you can carry throughout the day. This CBD oil blend is chock full of ingredients that support a healthy, thriving immune system, like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-curious-cbd-co-stars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">curcumin and coenzyme Q10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and the potential covid-blocking effects of CBG (strictly referencing the study). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1840291 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-202x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx uk photo lifestyle tinctures apr " width="202" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-202x300.jpg 202w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-690x1024.jpg 690w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-60x89.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-110x163.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021-300x445.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cbdfx-uk-photo-lifestyle-tinctures-01-apr-30-2021.jpg 714w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a>Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, has a wide range of wellness benefits that also work to protect your body. With robust </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s quickly become an integral part of wellness routines across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coenzyme Q10 is packed with tons of antioxidant properties, as well. Your body produces it naturally, but this production tends to slow with age. Still, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178961/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s an essential nutrient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that helps improve immune function, too! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD tinctures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like this are incredibly versatile and work in various recipes. We talked briefly about smoothies, but why stop the fun there? You can use our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in salad dressings or even add a few drops to your avocado toast in the morning!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Importance of Sleep </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever felt kinda ehhh, but then you went to bed early and woke up feeling like a million bucks again? This, my friends, is the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-sleep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">power of a good night’s rest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! When you sleep, you give all the systems in your body a chance to recharge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-melatonin-gummies-for-sleep/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1784365 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020-187x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle gummies melatonin jul " width="187" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020-187x300.jpg 187w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020-637x1024.jpg 637w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020-300x482.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020-60x96.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-gummies-melatonin-13-jul-24-2020.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></a>When you hit the sheets, your body produces cytokines that help reduce inflammation in the body and strengthen your body’s immune memory. If you have trouble sleeping at night, try implementing some of these practices before bed. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">• <a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-signs-you-need-a-digital-detox/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put the phone down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and make sure it’s out of reach, so you’re not tempted to “check one more thing.” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Try </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/create-a-cbd-self-care-routine-in-3-simple-steps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep breathing and stretching before bed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to unwind your mind and body. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Take a couple of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-melatonin-gummies-for-sleep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Gummies with Melatonin for Sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These CBD gummies taste amazing and help regulate your circadian rhythm when it gets thrown out of sync. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You already know sleep is essential, so it’s all about creating a “bedtime” schedule, putting the phone down (why is this so hard?), and tossing in some yummy CBD sleep products to hone in on quality ZZZs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts on CBG, CBD, and Covid-19</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a CBD enthusiast, hearing the media report that cannabinoids may play a part in preventing Covid was crazy exciting. However, we must keep in mind the research is young — but still very promising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunity has always been important, but the onset of Covid-19 only increases the spotlight on health and wellness. Of course, everyone has their own go-to wellness remedies, so whatever you do, keep doing it, but don’t be afraid to add new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and products to your routine, especially our CBG products! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brace yourselves, ladies and gents. It&#8217;s the cold and flu season. We know how challenging it is to stay healthy this time of the year, which is why it’s essential to focus on your health and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your immune system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, no matter how much effort you put into wellness, things can get stressful, especially </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/dealing-with-back-to-office-anxiety/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you work in an office setting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, there are plenty of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD products that’ll help you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find some peace and boost your immune system at the same time. So let’s take a closer look at how you can stay in the best health possible when you’re on the clock. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD and Immunity </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1829395 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-300x178.jpg" alt="cbdfx us blog  Ways to Boost Your Immune System" width="371" height="220" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-4-Ways-to-Boost-Your-Immune-System.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /></a>While we can’t make any direct claims about </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and immunity, we can talk about the science behind it. Studies show </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interfere with the release of cytokines, a protein that causes inflammation in a wide range of chronic health conditions. As a result, CBD has shown that it can have wellness benefits for the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/4-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immune system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know the best part? It&#8217;s easy to usher CBD into your daily routine, and when combined with other healthy habits, you have a much better chance to stay in good health and spirit. So, let’s discuss some of those healthy habits, so you can stay healthy when you’re at work. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink More Water </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1803683" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water-188x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx drink more water" width="206" height="329" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water-188x300.jpg 188w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water-641x1024.jpg 641w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water-300x480.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water-60x96.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-drink-more-water.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" />Staying hydrated is a crucial part of health and wellness. When you’re dehydrated, you may experience headache, fatigue, muscle cramps, and dizziness — to name a few. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human body is roughly 60% water, so staying hydrated is how you keep wellness on the up and up. </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improves energy and focus, and may give your metabolism a boost, making it a little easier to keep the waistline slim and trim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about energy levels suffering without coffee throughout the day, try keeping one of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-shots-20mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Focus Shots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your desk for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/does-cbd-work-for-energy-and-focus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you need an energizing boost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Take your pick between tangy pomegranate or a delicious tropical flavor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our CBD Focus Shots has a mood-elevating blend of broad spectrum CBD, jitter-free (time-released) caffeine, and L-arginine for healthy blood flow, which proves to be helpful when you’re sitting at a desk for hours on end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of CBDfx products that allow you to enhance health and wellness with little effort on your part. However, our latest innovation, the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have quickly become a crowd favorite with an immune-boosting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, energizing blend of adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms, including cordyceps, chaga, and lion’s mane. </span></p>

You’ll hit your daily water goal before you know it!</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the Vending Machine</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know the scenario. You keep walking past the vending machine, eyeing that bag of hot Cheetos. Then, BAM! One day you can’t resist, and before you know it, you’re sitting there full of remorse, staring at your neon orange fingertips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding the vending machine is a must for staying healthy in the workplace, especially if you tend to go for unhealthy snacks. Studies show that snacks full of sugar and refined carbohydrates lower the immune system, making you more susceptible to cold viruses and other bacteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to keep your immune system healthy, adding our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-mens-multivitamin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Gummies with Multivitamins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your daily routine </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-we-love-green-gummies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes a difference you can feel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It gives your immune system a boost and contains an array of vitamins and nutrients to enhance all aspects of wellness. When your body has the proper nutrients, you feel energized, optimistic, and ready to conquer whatever the day brings. </span></p>

They’re delicious, easy to take, and you can find a wide range of formulations with wellness-boosting ingredients — making it that much easier to make health and wellness a priority. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful Tip: Bring a packed lunch and snacks from home to avoid unhealthy temptations.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep Your Distance </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper distance in the workplace is essential these days, given the dangers of COVID. The CDC recommends keeping six feet distance from others when possible, but of course, there will be times you have to work closely with people for specific projects or meetings. When this time comes, sit a couple of seats apart and wear your mask to protect both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some additional tips you can utilize to keep a safe distance in the workplace: </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider rearranging desks to space them out a little more (or suggest this to your supervisor). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat at your desk instead of eating in the breakroom. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize Zoom and other telecommunication tools for larger meetings. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid crowded spaces in general, and make sure you always have your mask on. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very idea of being in the office and working near others brings anxious feelings for some. So, if you get stressed and anxious thinking about staying healthy when working around others, consider keeping one of our CBD Vape Pens in your pocket or purse (check with your company, of course, to see where they stand on this). </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/10-facts-you-need-to-know-about-disposable-cbd-vape-pens/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD vapes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a quick, discreet way to ease nerves and tension that accumulates when you&#8217;re facing a challenging situation. When you take a puff of your pen, the cannabinoids are absorbed into the bloodstream swiftly — giving vape pens the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest bioavailability rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and your quickest access to CBD “chill.” </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanitize Your Workspace </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1915629" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-300x300.jpg" alt="sanitize workspace" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sanitize-workspace.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There are plenty of reasons products, like Lysol and Lysol Wipes, were impossible to find for the entire year of 2020 — they’re effective in killing germs. When you work in an office with others, you must remember that everyone touches the same surfaces hundreds (maybe thousands) of times throughout the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these surfaces include door handles, elevator buttons, water coolers, counters, tables, vending machines (but you won’t be there, right? haha), printers, and much more. Of course, it’s impossible to avoid all germs, but washing your hands and using sanitizer throughout the day is an absolute must when it comes to staying healthy at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to add another layer of protection, consider adding our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your self-care routine. With a 2:1 ratio of CBD to CBG, alongside wellness-boosting turmeric and coenzyme Q10, you’ll feel more confident and protected when you walk through those doors every morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turmeric and coenzyme Q10 are a powerful blend of nutrients with robust antioxidant and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-inflammatory properties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that enhance health and wellness with every easy-to-manage serving. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful tip: Keep a pack of sanitizing wipes at your desk and wipe your workspace down a couple of times a day. </span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combat Eye Strain and Body Aches</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1853002 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-182x300.jpg" alt="wellness tincture on white" width="182" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-182x300.jpg 182w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-621x1024.jpg 621w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-60x99.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-110x181.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white-300x495.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wellness-tincture-on-white.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" /></a>Now that we’ve covered some germ-related ways to stay healthy in the workplace, let’s cover some of the more common issues: eye strain and body aches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at a computer screen for hours on end, it’s only a matter of time until your eyes become strained. Your eyes might feel dry, you might have blurred vision, and shoulder pain is even possible when you’re constantly in a hunched position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some things you can do to avoid eye strain: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try blue light blocking glasses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take frequent breaks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjust your lighting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use artificial tears to combat dry eyes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sit at a computer for a good chunk of the day, eye strain and body aches will occur — unless you implement some preventative measures. Some of the most common complaints include lower back pain, hip pain, wrist pain, neck and shoulder pain, and a few others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1541931214581100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study back in 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found adjusting your workspace with ergonomic chairs or standing desks significantly improves musculoskeletal issues people encounter from sitting for long periods. So, consider how you can switch up your office furniture — desk, chair, wrist cushion — to support you during the workday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you figure out your changes, make sure you keep one of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming CBD Balm Sticks </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your desk! You might not need it with your ergonomic adjustments, but it never hurts to have a comforting blend of chamomile, lavender, tea tree, and up to 3000mg of broad spectrum CBD to soothe tense areas of the body. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts on Staying Healthy in the Workplace </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought of heading back to the workplace is a significant </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-simple-ways-to-relieve-work-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source of concern and anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some people.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD is everywhere these days. You can find it in bottled water, self-care products, food, even cocktails — but CBD-infused anything comes at a price. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s best to learn how to make your own CBD drinks when you’re chilling at the house! We recently released a </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-cocktail-recipes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD cocktail blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you guys loved it, so we’re back with a sequel article featuring more CBD cocktails from the CBDfx kitchen!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cover some of the basics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so you know exactly what to expect when you decide to work on your CBD mixology skills. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBD? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1754350" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx tincture dropper mct oil" width="192" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg 192w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-654x1024.jpg 654w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-300x470.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-60x94.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" />CBD stands for cannabidiol. It comes from the cannabis hemp plant and provides a wide range of therapeutic benefits that many have come to appreciate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look forward to after a long day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD is capable of such incredible benefits because the hemp plant contains over 100 different types of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they all possess their own impressive skill set and effects. Most importantly, some cannabinoids (like CBD) don’t have any psychoactive effects. This is perfect for those who want the calming, soothing effects without feeling “high.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, most people want to know why CBD cocktails? What’s the benefit of adding high-quality cannabinoids to my favorite adult beverage? We’re glad you asked. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Cocktails Benefits </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to take advantage of the benefits of CBD, but CBD cocktails are a great way to add CBD to your day and liven things up in the process. CBD cocktails are fun, easy to make, and are great conversation starters for any gathering or party (just make sure your guests know they’re CBD-infused!). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also an excellent approach for those just getting acquainted with CBD, since all you need to do is add a couple of drops of your favorite </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD tincture oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the most significant benefits of CBD is that it gives your after-work cocktail an added “chill” factor! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering which CBD product you should use to make your first round of CBD cocktails? Here are our top picks for CBD cocktails, along with some tasty recipes. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind of CBD Products Make the Best CBD-Infused Cocktails? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/chill-shots/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1905148 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-268x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product shots  sept  " width="192" height="215" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-268x300.jpg 268w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-768x861.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-60x67.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-110x123.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021-300x336.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-shots-04-sept-30-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /></a>When you’re ready to test your CBD mixology skills, you’ll need to make sure you have the right tools on deck! The cool thing about CBD cocktails is that you can use just about any CBD tincture or concentrated drink to create your beverage. However, you want to make sure you know what kind of taste your tincture has, so you pair it with the right type of flavors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of our favorite tinctures and some drink recipes to pair them with.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/chill-shots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Chill Shots</span></a></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, our Chill Shots come in two flavors that pair exceptionally well with most drink concoctions. First up is tangy Lemonade. Here’s one of our favorite CBD cocktail recipes featuring CBD Lemonade Chill Shots!</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, But How Much CBD Do I Use? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest questions people have about making CBD cocktails is how much CBD to put in the drinks. This </span><b>greatly depends on your experience level </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with cannabinoids. If you’re new to CBD, you want to take things slow and keep track of your serving amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You still want to monitor your intake if you have experience, but you have a little more wiggle room because you understand serving amounts, effects, and other essential aspects of CBD. To be safe, check the recommended serving size on your product packaging and adhere to that recommendation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts on CBD Cocktails </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays are upon us, so it’s the perfect time to whip up some of these CBD cocktail recipes to keep your cool amidst all the hustle and bustle. Keep in mind that all of the products we suggested today in our recipes contain organic hemp that’s lab-tested with the highest level of quality and care — so you can sip assured (pun intended!). </span></p>

Of course, you were probably on your way out to buy another bottle of cologne, a lovely scarf, or maybe just a gift card to be totally safe — but what fun is that? </span></p>

All the more reason to check out our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gift guide, so you know which friend, family member, or loved one would appreciate this much loved </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, let’s take a deeper dive into delta-9 THC, so we’re all on the same page. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Delta-9 THC? </span></h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1898428 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-293x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product thc tinctures pens nov " width="293" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-293x300.jpg 293w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-768x785.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-60x61.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-110x112.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021-300x307.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-thc-tinctures-pens-nov-22-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know what you’re thinking — is delta-9 THC </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> THC? The one in marijuana? Well, yes, delta-9 (or tetrahydrocannabinol) is the very same THC that causes the intoxicating effects in marijuana. But our THC (and CBD, for that matter) is derived from the low-THC form of cannabis called hemp. Hemp has legally non-intoxicating levels of THC (less than 0.3%). What we’ve done with our CBD + Delta-9 THC products is bump up the level of THC in some of our full spectrum products to be as close to the legal limit as possible. Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, THC actually has some wonderful wellness benefits, just as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does. And by pumping up the delta-9 level in your product, we’re helping you to maximize those wellness benefits, as well as the blissful relaxation effects that have made THC so popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at some popular Delta-9 THC products with an eye toward who on your list would benefit the most!</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chill THC Drops for Career-Focused Friends </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working towards your goals is hard, especially when you have to pull yourself out of your comfy bed and go to the office (or work site or wherever!) five days a week. Most of us have a few career-driven friends who burn the candle at both ends and have a hard time relaxing because they’re always on the hustle. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-drops-ultimate-chill-blend/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + Delta-9 THC Drops: Ultimate Chill Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are precisely what this friend needs — especially if they’re already acquainted with THC!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of CBD and THC encourages a deeper level of calm and focus that any artist could use to get into the “zone.” In addition, they’ll love how the tincture embodies a sweet hint of blueberries that works well on its own or in a juice or smoothie, too. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to Remember When Shopping for Delta-9 THC Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our latest collection of CBD + Delta-9 THC products contains added THC for enhanced therapeutic effects and super-chill relaxation. It’s essential to keep the gift recipient’s experience level in mind when shopping for friends and family, because these THC tincture oils and vape pens can cause psychotropic effects if they take them in high enough quantities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we think there are many people you’re shopping for who will welcome this blissful, chill experience. And hey, maybe you can check off those last few names on your list!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we are a couple of weeks out from the big day, and you still have some people to cross off your holiday shopping list. Of course, it’s always hard to find those last few gifts. You know, for the people who have everything, or the people who are a complete mystery as to what they’d like. Think about it like this. Everyone needs at least one of two things at any given time: focus or relaxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we&#8217;ve got a couple of great </span><b>gift ideas</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help solve your dilemma. But these aren&#8217;t your typical energy-stimulating and chill-enhancing supplements. Both of these gifts contain wellness-boosting mushrooms — something that strengthens various aspects of health and wellness and stands out from all those other gifts they&#8217;ll receive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to give the gift of wellness this year, keep reading — because we’re going to take a deep dive into our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mushroom Extract Tinctures with CBD Oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Wellness Mushrooms</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-gummies/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1904088 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product mushrooms dec " width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-product-mushrooms-03-dec-02-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When most people hear about mushrooms, they automatically think about “magic mushrooms.” You know, the psychedelic ’shrooms. But </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-complete-guide-to-mushrooms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicinal mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in a league of their own, full of wellness-boosting properties that have been around for centuries — dating all the way back to 10,000 BCE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous modern-day medicines contain the </span><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/best_medicinal_mushroom_health_benefits/article.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">powerful wellness properties of medicinal mushrooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our </span><b>CBD mushroom products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> draw from six of these kinds of mushrooms: </span><b>chaga</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>cordyceps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>lion’s mane</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>maitake</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>reishi</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>turkey tail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mushrooms. Each of these healthful mushrooms are known as </span><b>adaptogenic mushrooms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because they can reduce different types of stress within the body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We just released our Mushroom Extract Tinctures with </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they&#8217;re quickly becoming a best-seller! Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer a wide range of therapeutic benefits, further enhanced with wellness-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! So, let’s figure out who on your shopping list would benefit most from both of these revolutionary formulations!</span></p>

With 100mg of organically grown cordyceps for energy, lion’s mane for stress relief, and chaga mushrooms for improved immunity — alongside </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad spectrum CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus 2.5mg of CBG (“</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the mother of all cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) per serving — it&#8217;s easy to see how this game-changing blend became a crowd-favorite so fast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you wondering who would love to add this blend to their daily routine? </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD, Mushrooms &amp; CBG: The Perfect Gift for Exhausted Moms and Dads </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone with kids (especially young kids) knows how exhausting — yet rewarding — parenting can be. However, when you factor in other aspects of “adulting,” things get a little crazy and chaotic. It’s hard to keep up with everything on your to-do list, and wellness always seems to take a backseat. This is why the Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend make the perfect </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-top-6-cbd-products-for-stressed-out-parents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stocking stuffer for any on-the-go parent.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding this blend to their morning routine helps improve wellness, especially when they forget to take vitamins or supplements (which may happen a lot). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;ll help reduce brain fog for those days they feel scattered. But it also has energizing properties to keep them moving at a productive pace through the day — without the extra cup of coffee. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mushrooms + CBD: Energy and Focus for Your College Student </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1904093" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student--300x260.jpg" alt="Mushrooms CBD Energy and Focus for Your College Student " width="300" height="260" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student--300x260.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student--768x666.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student--60x52.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student--110x95.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mushrooms-CBD-Energy-and-Focus-for-Your-College-Student-.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />You know the college student in your life who’s constantly stressed about exams and dissertations?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, our Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend can help improve memory and concentration — and hopefully help them ace all those exams!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mushroom Drops: Give Your Creative Chef a New Culinary Ingredient</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the perks of having a culinary genius as a close friend or family member is getting the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-recipes-for-every-occasion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first taste of their latest creations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That said, the chef&#8217;s life is fast and chaotic (have you ever been inside a busy restaurant kitchen during a dinner rush?!). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we have a sneaking suspicion that your chef friend or loved one won’t be able to resist adding a few drops of our Focus Mushroom CBD Oil Drops to a homemade mushroom soup, smoothie, or any other culinary creation that comes to mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new formulation has a delicious flavor profile that pairs well with a wide variety of culinary dishes. They could easily add a few drops to their daily smoothie or weekend bloody mary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s get to the folks on your list who need some serious “chill” time …</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend</span></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1904094 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend-200x300.jpg" alt="Unwind Mushroom CBD Drops CBN Relax Blend" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend-60x90.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend-110x165.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend-300x451.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Unwind-Mushroom-CBD-Drops-CBN-Relax-Blend.jpg 532w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a>We all have a few friends who don’t know how to relax, no matter how hard they try. That’s why our Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend are the gift that keeps on giving. This soothing blend of adaptogenic mushrooms, CBD, CBN (“</span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ultimate relaxation cannabinoid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), and immunity-boosting nutrients produces a unique, comforting vibe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the perfect gift for the loved one who needs to unwind their mind and body after a long day. Here are a few people who could really use the “chill” vibe of our Unwind Mushroom Drops …</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mushrooms + CBN: Ideal for Busy Entrepreneurs </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know any serial entrepreneurs — someone who excels in all things business-related, but doesn’t know how to slow down? They’re always hustling, and don’t alway think to take care of themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These folks need to find a good balance that helps them maintain health and wellness, because it’s easy to burn out. Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend are the perfect addition to their nightly, wind-down routine, because it’s hard to generate that million-dollar idea without a fresh, well-rested mind!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re officially in the holiday season, which means you’ve most likely started buying gifts for loved ones and friends — but what about the special furry friend in your life? Our pets are just as much a part of the family as anyone else. Still, it’s a little harder to find a gift for your pet that’ll have a meaningful impact. We know what you’re thinking: </span><b>dogs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>cats</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t care about that! </span><b>Pets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just want something that smells like bacon and tastes good. (Who doesn’t!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this is true for your </span><b>dog</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>cat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as their caregiver, how cool would it be to give your pet something that can improve their overall wellness. Not sure where to start? Don&#8217;t worry, we made this </span><b>CBD gift guide for pets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you can get a better understanding of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd-for-pets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which products work best for certain pets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and their personalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’ve been thinking about letting your pet test the </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> waters, this holiday is the purrrfect time (pun intended) to introduce them to healthful (no THC!) cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the overactive pets who need a little more help calming down.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Hyperactive Pets </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cats-and-the-3-a-m-zoomies/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1829381 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-300x178.jpg" alt="cbdfx us blog Cats and the a m Zoomies" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-Cats-and-the-3-a.m.-Zoomies.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Some pets are naturally more hyper than others, whether it’s due to their breed or distinct personality traits. If the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cats-and-the-3-a-m-zoomies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 a.m. zoomies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a common occurrence for your pet, adding one of our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cat-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Pet Oils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their daily routine adds some much-needed chill to both of your days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most pet owners ponder the idea of </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-pets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD for pets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but when it comes to securing the best CBD formulation for your dog or cat, the choices can be overwhelming. This is why we try to simplify the process as much as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re shopping for </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-dogs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDfx pet tinctures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll notice a wide variety of oil drops — you can even shop by breed size! CBD tinctures are one of the best starter CBD products to introduce your pet to, because it’s super simple to serve them: just add a couple of drops to your dog or cat’s food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-for-dogs/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1900403 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021-264x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle pettincture mar " width="264" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021-264x300.jpg 264w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021-60x68.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021-110x125.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021-300x341.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettincture-03-mar-30-2021.jpg 704w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /></a>You’ll want to start with a small serving amount (keep track of the actual amount) and work your way up in concentration, day after day, until you can see that your cat or dog has reached their effective serving. We have a wide selection of organically grown and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab-tested CBD pet products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it’s all about finding the </span><b>best CBD pet oil</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the size and type of pet you have. Your pet will always have their active moments, but they’ll appreciate laid-back vibes in the right moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s move on to an area that’s bound to overlap with hyperactive pets: stress and anxiety.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Stressed and Anxious Pets</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study found that more than </span><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/many-dogs-are-prone-to-anxiety-study-finds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% of dogs display signs of anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — 70%?! That’s a lot of nervous vibes flowing through our furry friends. Separation anxiety is common among many different kinds of pets, especially if they’re home alone when you go to work. As a result, these pups (and kitties) often display destructive behaviors like excessive barking, chewing, digging, shredding, and howling, to name a few. While we can’t make any direct medical claims (by law), countless pet owners love how CBD is an all-natural, safe supplement for their pets that mellows them out when they have to be alone for a bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-pet-treats-stress-anxiety-450mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1900406 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020-265x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle pettreats dec " width="265" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020-265x300.jpg 265w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020-60x68.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020-110x124.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020-300x339.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-pettreats-11-dec-30-2020.jpg 731w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a>Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-pet-treats-stress-anxiety-450mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Pet Treats for Stress and Anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a favorite of dogs, and are packed with botanical extracts, plant-based nutrients, and non-intoxicating broad spectrum CBD. These CBD dog treats also include mood-elevating ingredients, like GABA, a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses to nerve cells in the brain. These impulses can trigger stress and anxiety, but </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-gaba#1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GABA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a unique way of relaxing the brain in instances like this. Besides, we’ve never met a dog whose tail didn’t wag with a treat in sight!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Older Pets</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aging is hard on everyone — especially our pets. Mobility is one of the most </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/caring-for-an-older-pet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressing issues for our older pets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s harder for our older dogs and cats to get around, because their joints can become stiff and achy. This problem gets worse without proper diet and exercise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a pet owner, it’s hard to watch your pet struggle with routine daily tasks, like climbing the stairs or jumping up on the bed. Dogs can’t express how much pain they’re in, which has to be one of the most challenging things about caring for an older pet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-pet-treats-joint-mobility-450mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1414033 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx pet treats joint mobility" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cbdfx-pet-treats-joint-mobility.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-pet-treats-joint-mobility-450mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Pet Treats for Joints and Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contain a nutritious blend of powerful antioxidants, like parsley, blueberries, and spinach. But we didn’t stop there. Each mouth-watering dog treat contains 15mg of broad spectrum CBD, alongside the anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric to encourage healthy joints and better movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving good gifts (yes, even to your pets) means thinking about what they need and asking, what could make their life a little easier or happier? An aging pet can appreciate the soothing, comforting relief that CBD is capable of providing. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Pets With Dry or Irritated Skin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another note, sometimes our pets accumulate worn-out </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-a-cbd-pet-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">patches on their paws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When this happens, dogs can greatly benefit from a shea butter paw massage with our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming and Moisturizing CBD Pet Balm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pawsome formulation contains odorless Alaskan salmon oil with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. This oil provides robust anti-inflammatory properties to promote a healthy coat and have other wellness benefits for your dog. Additionally, shea butter moisturizes dry skin, reduces inflammation, and provides soothing relief to itchy and peeling skin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/calming-and-moisturizing-pet-cbd-balm/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1821513 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-294x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product petbalm jun " width="243" height="248" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-1003x1024.jpg 1003w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-768x784.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-60x61.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-110x112.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021-300x306.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-product-petbalm-04-jun-08-2021.jpg 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></a>Candelilla wax hydrates and smoothes parched, scaly skin. And on top of all that, we’ve added a blend of lavender, rosemary and Roman chamomile essential oils to nurture your dog’s skin even further. Taken together, these ingredients provide welcome relief for pets suffering from skin issues, whether it’s their paws, nose, or some other area of skin that needs relief. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Gifts for Cats </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people might not understand why cats would need CBD, but cats face most of the same issues other pets face (see anything familiar in those grumpy cat videos?). Our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cat-tincture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Tincture Oil for Cats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great stocking stuffer for the special kitty in your life. It’s chicken-flavored, and contains 250mg of broad spectrum, human-grade CBD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cat-tincture/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1881610 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-300x300.jpg" alt="Exclusive Mockups for Branding and Packaging Design" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-pet-chicken-cat-250-nov-03-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Want to mix it up? As with our best-selling CBD Dog Tinctures, our cat oil drops also come in delicious </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-for-cats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bacon flavor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pet owners worldwide love our pet tinctures, because they’re all lab-tested and formulated with natural MCT oil for enhanced absorption. CBDfx CBD Pet Tincture proves to be especially helpful if outside noises easily stress your cat, since it helps soothe the mind and body, helping them get the rest they need to live a healthier, happier life. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CBD Products for Big Dogs </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re shopping for a larger breed of dogs, you have to remember that the type of CBD you purchase can make or break their actual CBD experience. That said, your dog’s weight, height, metabolism, and other factors play a big part, too. This is why your big pooch needs a CBD tincture with a greater concentration of cannabinoids than the tinctures you would give a smaller dog or a cat.
