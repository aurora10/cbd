										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping for CBD can be challenging. Beyond the myriad of CBD brands and products, there’s also the matter of the <strong>CBD oil</strong> itself being used in your gummies or tincture oil. It turns out, not all CBD is created equal. And the type of CBD oil being used in your product can have a huge impact on your overall CBD experience.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll take a deep dive into the most robust of all types of CBD oil: <strong>full spectrum CBD</strong>. We’ll look not only at what <strong>full-spectrum CBD</strong> is and how it might impact the experience you have with a particular product, but also we’ll explore CBDfx’s diverse line of <strong>full spectrum CBD products</strong> so you can find the product that works best for you. But first things first: What exactly is CBD oil?</p>
<h2>What Is CBD Oil?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1754350" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx tincture dropper mct oil" width="192" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-192x300.jpg 192w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-654x1024.jpg 654w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-300x470.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil-60x94.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-tincture-dropper-mct-oil.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" />CBD oil, or hemp oil, is the oil that is derived from the stalks, buds, and leaves of the cannabis hemp plant. This is not to be confused with hemp-seed oil, which doesn’t contain CBD or other cannabinoids. CBD oil, though, contains a rich blend of all the cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids of the cannabis hemp plant.</p>
<h2>Full Spectrum CBD</h2>
<p>Full-spectrum CBD is the initial extract from the hemp plant with no additional filtration. That means it contains all of the 100-plus cannabinoids of the hemp plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and even trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3% by law). This oil is also rich in terpenes (which give the hemp plant its scent and taste) and flavonoids (which give hemp its color). All of these chemical compounds, as well as those healthy fatty acids we mentioned) provide a wealth of health and wellness benefits.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1106319" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/full-spectrum.svg" alt="full spectrum" width="56" height="56" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 2048w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/full-spectrum.svg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 56px) 100vw, 56px" />But the effects of these various compounds are more than merely the sum of their individual parts. It turns out that multiple cannabinoids, when taken together, actually bolster one another’s effects through a phenomenon known as the Entourage Effect. So, when you take a product that contains full-spectrum CBD, you not only benefit from all the individual cannabinoids and other compounds, but you also get them to perform at peak power and effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Broad Spectrum CBD &amp; CBD Isolate</h2>
<p>We mentioned that full-spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC and, while it’s not enough THC to get you high, the presence of delta-9 can be a dealbreaker for some people. So, there are forms of CBD with the THC filtered out.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1106309" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg" alt="broad spectrum" width="56" height="56" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 2048w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads//2020/10/broad-spectrum.svg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 56px) 100vw, 56px" /></p>
<p><strong>Broad spectrum CBD</strong> is pretty much the same oil as full spectrum, only a filtration process takes place to remove the THC. This filtration also takes out a few of the other compounds in the process. Nevertheless, most of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids remain in the oil, giving you a CBD oil that is still quite robust and can deliver a solid, albeit slightly diminished Entourage Effect.</p>
<p><strong>CBD isolate</strong> is CBD with all other cannabis compounds removed, leaving you with a powder that’s 99% pure CBD. CBD isolate does not deliver the Entourage Effect, as it contains no complementary cannabinoids, but it does offer a flavorless, odorless form of CBD that can be useful for products, like vape oils or bath products, where the product designer can make use of a clean, open palette.</p>
<h2>Full-Spectrum CBD Products</h2>
<p>Full spectrum CBD products make use of that maximized assortment of cannabis compounds to offer the deepest cannabinoid experience possible. We’ve created a variety of full-spectrum products, so that you too can enjoy the full benefits of the Entourage Effect.</p>
<h3>Full-Spectrum CBD Capsules</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2149869 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-224x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle soft gel capsules  aug  " width="224" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-224x300.jpg 224w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-766x1024.jpg 766w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-768x1027.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-60x80.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-110x147.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-300x401.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022.jpg 799w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a>While we do offer multiple broad-spectrum CBD capsules, we also have a full spectrum capsule that delivers a powerful CBD experience. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD Soft Gel Capsules</a> are available in your choice of 25 or 50mg CBD servings. The only other ingredients are coconut-derived MCT oil for improved absorption, and gelatin to form the capsules. These CBD Softgels are the perfect product for people who want to try full-spectrum oil without other ingredients to cloud the experience, making them ideal for managing stress or simply chilling out at the end of a long day.</p>
<h3>Full-Spectrum CBD Oil Tinctures</h3>
<p>Similar to our CBD Soft Gel Capsules, our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</a> delivers a potent full spectrum experience, but with a few restful additions. With strengths ranging from 1000mg to 6000mg CBD, you’ve already got a powerful dose of full-spectrum oil in this CBD oil tincture. But we’ve also added bonus CBN, known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” and a proprietary blend of restful terpenes, to give you a wonderful calming product, great for a relaxing “chill sesh” or an effective wind-down before bedtime.</p>
<h3>Full Spectrum Delta 9 THC Products</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2149871 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle ultimatechill  mar  " width="221" height="223" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022.jpg 793w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-298x300.jpg 298w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-768x774.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-110x111.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-300x302.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-ultimatechill-01-mar-23-2022-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></a>While the legal delta-9 THC limit for hemp products in the US is less than 0.3%, often the full-spectrum extract yields significantly less THC than that. Many CBD enthusiasts prefer to have the additional THC, for both relaxation purposes and for the health benefits of THC. For these people, we’ve created a line of full-spectrum CBD products with additional delta-9 THC, taking the THC level right up to the legal limit. Our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC</a> line offers a variety of max-THC products to choose from.</p>
<h4>CBD + THC Gummies</h4>

<p>Whatever full spectrum delta 9 product you choose, you can be assured you’re getting only the finest in organic hemp and all-natural ingredients when you shop with CBDfx.</p>
<h2>Shopping for Quality CBD</h2>
<p>When you’re shopping for CBD — whether it’s a full-spectrum product or not — it’s important to verify the purity and potency of your product. Make sure the CBD company you choose uses organic hemp for their CBD oils, and make sure that hemp oil was extracted with clean CO2, so there’s no possibility of potentially harmful solvent residues in your product.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and potency of your CBD product by looking for a third-party lab report, or Certificate of Analysis. This report will tell you how much CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids are in your product, and also alert you to the presence of any harmful chemicals. At CBDfx, we insist on these three criteria for every product we make. Your safety and satisfaction are our primary concerns.</p>
<p>And when it comes to full spectrum hemp products, remember to start with a smaller dosage if this is your first time trying a product made with full spectrum CBD oil. Everyone’s bodies are different, so it’s important to be able to gauge how CBD full spectrum products affect you. We wish you health and happiness on your CBD journey!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a plant that’s been used by humans for thousands of years, for everything from rope and paper manufacturing to pain relief and other wellness benefits. It’s also suffered from a basic misunderstanding due to its unfair association with marijuana. The plant we’re talking about is, of course, <strong>hemp</strong>. And it’s not only a plant of historical significance; it’s also the source of the hottest health supplement of the past decade: <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBD</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>What Is Hemp?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1862757" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-300x178.jpg" alt="WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEMP AND MARIJUANA" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WHATS-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-HEMP-AND-MARIJUANA.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-hemp-good-for-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemp</a> is a form of the cannabis plant. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cannabis</strong></a> has been around for a long, long time. How long? Think dinosaurs-long. That’s right, the cannabaceae family dates back to the Cretaceous time period, with the oldest surviving fossils clocking in at 90 to 94 million years old!</p>
<p>Humans began domesticating these plants as far back as 12,000 years ago in East Asia. Some of cannabis’s early use was, as one might expect, for the mood-lifting effects associated with THC. And it was used for medicinal purposes, as well, including pain relief and sleep support. As a hearty stalk plant, cannabis came to be used to make rope, cloth, paper, and a host of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/7-things-you-might-not-realize-have-hemp-in-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other products</a>. It’s safe to say that cannabis has been an integral part of human civilization, though early 20th century laws in the US and beyond changed things for a number of years.</p>
<p>As the government cracked down on high-THC cannabis, commonly referred to as marijuana, low-THC <a href="https://cbdfx.com/seeds-to-space-a-history-of-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp</a> got caught in the crossfire. It wasn’t until the 2018 US Farm Bill that hemp was finally legalized at the national level.</p>
<p>So, how do we connect the dots from hemp to all those great <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-gummies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD gummies</a> and other wellness products people have been enjoying in recent years? Well, let’s start by taking a closer look at the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/6-weird-facts-about-hemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp</a> plant itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/trichomes-why-does-cannabis-produce-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1861759" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg" alt="Trichomes Why Does Cannabis Produce Cannabinoids" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Trichomes</strong></a> are tiny growths on the surface of the cannabis plant. They produce a wide range of compounds that protect the plant. These include <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cannabinoids</strong></a> (such as CBD and THC), terpenes, and flavonoids.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Terpenes</strong></a> give cannabis its flavor and scent. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Flavonoids</strong></a> give plants their color. Like terpenes and flavonoids, the 100-plus cannabinoid compounds also serve a wide variety of functions, including protection against insect predators, grazing animals, UV light, and inclement weather. These compounds also attract pollinators, thus perpetuating the species.</p>
<h2>What Are Cannabinoids?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, cannabis produces over a hundred cannabinoid compounds. The two most prevalent (or, “major cannabinoids”) are CBD (cannabidiol) and THC (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>). Marijuana is heavy on the THC and a bit lighter in CBD content. Hemp is the opposite: high in CBD and low in THC. In fact, there is so little THC in hemp (less than 0.3%) that it’s non-intoxicating. Minor cannabinoids include <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBN</a> (cannabinol), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBG</a> (cannabigerol), and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC</a> (cannabichromene), along with many others.</p>
<p>Each of these compounds has a unique effect on the endocannabinoid system, found in the bodies of all vertebrate animals. It turns out, we also create cannabinoids. Our internally generated cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, serve as neurotransmitters, communicating with receptors in various systems and organs throughout the body, helping them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This, in turn, helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as sleep, pain, stress, motor control, immunity, mood, memory, appetite, and more.</p>
<p>CBD, THC, and other plant-based cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) interact with these same receptors, when consumed, and help to support these very same functions. The wellness benefits that stem from this interaction are the reason that CBD has become such a popular health supplement.</p>
<h2>Extracting CBD</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBD oil</strong></a> is extracted from the stalks, leaves, and buds of the hemp plant. This is different from <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-difference-between-cbd-oil-hemp-seed-oil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hemp seed oil</a> which, of course, comes from the seeds. While the oil from hemp seeds is great for skin care, it does not contain the same health-boosting compounds as CBD oil (sometimes called hemp oil). The initial extraction contains all of those compounds, including all cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and healthy fatty acids of the plant. This extract is called full spectrum CBD.</p>
<p>Because full spectrum CBD contains trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law), many people prefer to have the THC filtered out. This filtered version is called broad spectrum CBD. Broad spectrum oil is still a robust oil, containing nearly all the other hemp compounds of full spectrum, and is the desired oil for many users.</p>
<p>Some people prefer to have all other hemp material removed, leaving only the CBD. This 99% pure CBD is called CBD isolate. It’s a flavorless, odorless powder that can be useful in products, like some vape and bath products that require a clean palette for the product designer.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Organic Farming &amp; Safe Oil Extraction</h2>
<p>Hemp is what’s known as a bioaccumulator, meaning that it sucks up pretty much everything from the soil that surrounds the plant. This can be great when it comes to absorbing nutrients. In fact, it’s this powerful absorption that makes it easy to grow hemp (and all cannabis) in a wide variety of climates.</p>
<p>However, when the surrounding soil contains pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, and other toxins, that can be a problem. Ultimately, all of those potentially harmful compounds will not only be absorbed into the plant, but they’ll also end up in the CBD oil that’s extracted from the plant and, yes, they’ll be right there in the CBD products made from that oil. So, it’s vital to find CBD companies who work with farmers using organic techniques to grow their hemp crops. It’s the only way to ensure the purity of your hemp oil.</p>
<p>It’s also important to know how the CBD oil was extracted from the hemp. Some companies use cheaper methods involving solvents, such as butane, for extraction. This can leave behind potentially harmful residues in the oil. Though it might cost a bit more, it’s worth it to find a company that uses carbon dioxide to remove the CBD from the hemp. CO2 doesn’t leave behind a residue and is actually more efficient in pulling the cannabinoids from the hemp. So, you get a more pure and potent product when you choose a brand that uses CO2 extraction.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and the potency of your product by looking for a Certificate of Analysis (COA), which is a lab report generated by an independent, third-party laboratory. This report will tell you how much CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as any potentially harmful compounds that may have found their way into the mix. Never purchase a hemp product that is not accompanied by a COA.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Cannabis has a long and colorful history, stretching all the way back to the days of the T.Rex. Though it was vilified for nearly a century, due to its association with marijuana, low-THC hemp has rebounded to become one of the hottest health supplements of the 21st century.</p>
<p>As you explore hemp products, make sure to keep in mind some of the tips we mentioned in this article. Look for products made from organically grown hemp, with the oil extracted by means of clean CO2, and accompanied by a Certificate of Analysis. This will allow you to find the purest and most potent products available — and ensure your safety and satisfaction!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does seasonal change bring on sad feelings that never seem to go away? </span><a href="https://cannalogue.ca/column/column/health/can-medical-cannabis-help-with-seasonal-depression/"><b>Seasonal depression</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is real. In fact, it’s estimated that 11 million Americans suffer from </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder"><b>Seasonal Affective Disorder</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or SAD. But what exactly is this disorder, and what causes these intense feelings to bubble up? Today, we’ll explore this seasonal health issue and we’ll explore ways that </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><b>CBD</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be able to help you beat those </span><b>winter blues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder that occurs for some people at the same time every year. For most people, that time of year is fall and winter, when there’s less daylight and we generally spend less time outdoors. SAD is generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">characterized by elevated feelings of depression or anxiety. Warning signs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can include a constant state of being sad or cranky, fatigue, concentration problems, greater appetite and weight gain, the desire to be alone, and even suicidal thoughts. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2142242" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad.jpg" alt="sad" width="1000" height="335" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad.jpg 1000w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-300x101.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-768x257.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-60x20.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sad-110x37.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While research into this phenomenon is ongoing and we’re not certain of the exact causes of SAD, it’s believed that seasonal hormone changes are the biggest culprit. With less sunlight in the fall and winter, the brain makes less serotonin, which helps to regulate mood. When your serotonin levels are off, this can result in feelings of anxiety or depression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a less common summer variation of SAD (often called, “</span><b>summer depression</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), as well, which is characterized by loss of appetite, insomnia, and weight loss.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBD?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cannabidiol) is one of a group of chemical compounds created by the cannabis plant, called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are over a hundred such compounds in cannabis, and CBD is one of the two most prevalent (along with THC). CBD products, such as those sold by CBDfx, are made with CBD oil derived from a type of cannabis called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which contains only trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%, by law).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1825459 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-300x178.jpg" alt="cbdfx us blog What is the Endocannabinoid System" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-What-is-the-Endocannabinoid-System.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While cannabinoids, like CBD, generate a number of benefits for the plant, including warding away insect pests and grazing animals, these compounds also produce a number of beneficial effects for humans, as well as all vertebrate animals. This is due to CBD’s interaction with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><b>endocannabinoid system</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cell-signaling system that helps various organs and systems throughout the body to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This interaction helps the body to regulate a number of crucial functions, including mood, memory, appetite, sleep, pain, stress, motor control, immunity, and much more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are the Benefits of CBD Oil?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2142248" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-300x230.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product mondays nov  " width="300" height="230" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-300x230.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-768x590.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-60x46.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022-110x84.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cbdfx-photo-product-mondays-nov-04-2022.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Because of CBD’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system and its resulting benefits, cannabidiol is used now for a variety of needs. First and foremost, CBD is often taken as a booster for overall health and wellness. This is why you’ll often find CBD in daily wellness products, like our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-gummies-mens-multivitamin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Multivitamin Gummies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/wellness-tincture-cbd-cbg-oil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBG Wellness Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CBD also has natural calming properties, which make it ideal for stress-busting products, such as </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-capsules-750mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Soft Gel Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those same calming properties make CBD an ideal ingredient in natural sleep aids, such as our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-night-capsules-900mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD + CBN Night Capsules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Sleep Tincture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Among the most popular CBD topical products are our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Muscle &amp; Joint Cream: Cooling Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG + CBD Lotion for Muscle &amp; Joint: Heating Formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-muscle-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD Balm Stick for Muscle &amp; Joint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calming &amp; Moisturizing CBD Balm Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can It Combat Seasonal Affective Disorder?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we discuss whether CBD can combat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), it’s worth noting that research on the effects of CBD are still ongoing and the FDA has not approved the use of CBD for medical purposes. So, this article should not be construed as medical advice for the use of CBD. What we can do is discuss some of CBD’s noted effects and see how they might apply to a person suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder or depression. If you are suffering from a serious physical or mental condition, please consult your physician.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1774309" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-741x1024.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle calmingtincture  mar  " width="301" height="416" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-741x1024.jpg 741w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-768x1062.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-300x415.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021-60x83.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-calmingtincture-02-mar-30-2021.jpg 868w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a>As you were reading about CBD, you probably had a few “light bulb” moments, noting that CBD has been shown to affect the regulation of mood and stress. Indeed, the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-for-stress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calming effects of CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are wonderful for dealing with elevated nerves and stressful situations. While it’s certainly not a cure for depression, CBD can help relax your thoughts and relieve tension. This can be a useful tool if you’re dealing with SAD, along with increased time outdoors in the daylight (or artificial light therapy), vitamin D, and exercise. And again, if you are experiencing severe depression, please consult a medical professional.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can be debilitating if that depression lingers for an extended amount of time. If you think you’re suffering from SAD, the first step is to consult a medical professional. And consider ways to remove or reduce stress in your life. CBD is a great soother of nerves and could be useful if you’re dealing with SAD or just plain old anxiety. Try one of our best-selling CBD oil stressbusters today!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2130582" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-1024x984.jpg" alt="d icon" width="170" height="163" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-1024x984.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-300x288.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-768x738.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-60x58.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon-110x106.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/d9-icon.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" />To understand delta-9 products, it’s important to first understand just what </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><b>tetrahydrocannabinol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta-9 THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of a group of compounds that come from the </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, which are called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Delta-9 is one of two “major cannabinoids” (along with CBD), which are called so because they occur in high quantities in the plant. There are also over a hundred minor cannabinoids, such as CBG and CBN, which occur in very small quantities, but can have beneficial effects, as well. Cannabis also produces health-boosting </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/all-about-terpenes-complete-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-flavonoids-in-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flavonoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but let’s concentrate on those major cannabinoids: delta-9 and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ratios vary, depending on the type of cannabis you’re dealing with. Tetrahydrocannabinol occurs in very high concentrations in the type of cannabis we generally refer to as marijuana. Low-THC hemp, on the other hand, contains high concentrations of CBD (cannabidiol). Each of these cannabinoids has different properties, which yield differing effects on the mind and body. But they share in common the ability of nearly all cannabinoids to interact with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This cell-signaling system is interconnected with receptors in various organs and systems throughout the body. The body creates its own cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, which interact with these receptors and help those various organs and systems to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This, in turn, helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as sleep, pain suppression, stress relief, appetite, mood, memory, motor control, and much more. Plant-based cannabinoids, when consumed, mimic the body’s own endocannabinoids in delivering these benefits. CBD is particularly effective in helping the body maintain balance, which is why it has become such a popular wellness product. But delta-9 has many wellness benefits, too.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of the Cannabinoid, Tetrahydrocannabinol</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1868150" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-300x178.jpg" alt="What Is THC A Guide to Tetrahydrocannabinol" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-Is-THC-A-Guide-to-Tetrahydrocannabinol.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Let’s begin with the obvious: Tetrahydrocannabinol is the cannabinoid in marijuana that’s famous for getting you high. We mentioned that the benefits of cannabinoids stem from their interaction with the endocannabinoid system, affecting various bodily functions. Well, THC can go a bit overboard in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elevating your mood, sometimes boosting your appetite (got munchies?), affecting your motor control abilities, and so on. These are the reasons people generally use marijuana, to accentuate those effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in lower dosed hemp, THC can bring with it a host of wellness benefits, as well as powerful relaxation effects. People have used cannabis for millennia to take advantage of delta-9’s ability to calm nerves and ease stress. The calming properties of THC can help release tension in your muscles, which may also help with cramping and similar issues. Delta-9 can also elevate your mood, making bedtime or any “chill” session extra blissful. THC has been shown to have antihistamine and </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">antioxidant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits, as well, and can help prevent nausea. And (especially with indica cannabis strains) this potent cannabinoid can deliver wonderful sleep-supporting effects.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Cannabis Edibles?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2120299" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-300x164.jpg" alt="The Classic Edibles Mistake and How Not to Make It" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-300x164.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-768x419.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-60x33.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-110x60.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Classic-Edibles-Mistake-and-How-Not-to-Make-It-2048x1117.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />CBD and delta-9 cannabis edibles are simply products packed with a particular cannabinoid (or cannabinoids), that are consumed by eating or drinking. This means that the cannabinoid in question must pass through the digestive tract in order to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Popular cannabis edible products include CBD or delta-9 gummies, capsules, pills, cookies, brownies, drinks, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Cannabis Oil Tinctures?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinctures are oil products that are taken by using a dropper. Technically, tinctures are edibles if you simply swallow them or add them to a drink or food. In the case of this type of consumption, the oil cannabis tincture will need to travel through your digestive tract before you feel its effects. Generally, though — for reasons we’ll set forth below — tinctures are meant to be taken sublingually (under the tongue). In this way, the CBD or delta-9 cannabinoid is absorbed through the capillaries of the mouth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits &amp; Effects of Tinctures Versus Edible Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-2130590 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle THC group  mar  " width="330" height="203" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-300x184.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-768x471.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-60x37.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-THC-group-01-mar-23-2022-110x68.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" />In comparing tinctures and edibles, the tincture can have much faster-acting effects than edibles. This is because, when you take tinctures, the cannabis content doesn’t have to travel all the way through your digestive tract before being absorbed into your bloodstream. A sublingual tincture can deliver cannabis compounds into your bloodstream, generally speaking, in 15 to 30 minutes. We say “generally speaking,” because everyone’s body works differently and we all have differing </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioavailability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors that affect the way we absorb CBD and delta-9. These factors can include height, weight, metabolism, CBD or delta-9 tolerance, and more. As we say, compared to tinctures, edible products can take longer for you to feel the effects, generally 30 minutes to two hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like a no-brainer, then, to take tinctures vs cannabis edibles. You do generally feel the effects of a tincture quicker than an edible, after all. However, the effects of an edible can last considerably longer than the effects of cannabis tinctures. The effects of an oil tincture can last roughly four to six hours, depending on (you guessed it) bioavailability factors. The effects of a CBD or delta-9 edible, on the other hand, can last six to eight hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/delta-9-thc-capsules-cbd-daily-chill-blend/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2120288" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-294x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle d soft gel capsules  aug  " width="210" height="214" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-768x784.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-60x61.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-110x112.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022-300x306.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-soft-gel-capsules-03-aug-03-2022.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>So, it really comes down to how long you’re willing to wait for the effects of your cannabis product and how long you’d like those cannabis effects to last to determine whether cannabis oil drops or edibles are best for you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the Best Cannabis Products</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all cannabis products are created equally. In fact, many tinctures and edibles on the market are ineffective and even unsafe. So, it’s important to know what to look for when you’re shopping for cannabis tinctures and edibles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-gummies-berry-buzz-sativa/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2130592 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-207x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo product THCgummies  may  " width="207" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-60x87.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-110x160.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022-300x436.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-product-THCgummies-01-may-25-2022.jpg 551w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" /></a>First, make sure your CBD or delta-9 product is made with organic hemp, so there’s no likelihood that your oil or gummy contains pesticides, heavy metals, or other potentially harmful compounds that can be absorbed from the soil. And make sure the CBD oil was extracted by means of clean carbon dioxide, which won’t leave behind any potentially toxic residues, as can happen with some cheaper methods of oil extraction. The purity and potency of your product can be verified by checking that product’s Certificate of Analysis, which is a report conducted by an independent, third-party laboratory. This report will tell you how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in your product, as well as alert you to the presence of any contaminants.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re on the field every day or you simply hit the gym a couple times a week to keep in shape, you want your workouts to be as effective as possible. The point of all that work is to hit your fitness goals, whatever your goals may be. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBD</strong></a> can help you get there. In pre-workout energy products, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBD</a> can add focus to help you make the most of your reps. And after a grueling workout, CBD can help you recover faster, so you can get right back in the grind.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll take a look at what CBD is, and how CBD can benefit your training. We’ll also highlight some <strong>CBD workout products</strong> formulated to help you reach your fitness goals!</p>
<h2>What Is CBD?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1842023" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-180x300.jpg" alt="what are Phytocannabinoids" width="180" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-180x300.jpg 180w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-613x1024.jpg 613w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-60x100.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-110x184.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-300x501.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids.jpg 719w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" />Let’s start with a brief refresher on what exactly CBD is. Cannabidiol (CBD, for short) is one of a group of chemical compounds generated by the cannabis plant, called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabinoids</a>. There are over 100 of these cannabinoid compounds, with CBD and THC being the most abundant. As such, they’re generally referred to as the two “major cannabinoids.” The CBD in our products comes from hemp, a low-THC form of cannabis that won’t get you high, but will deliver a bevy of wellness benefits.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Work?</h2>
<p>Your body creates its own endocannabinoids, which are part of an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endocannabinoid system</a> (ECS). The endocannabinoid system signals to receptors in various systems and organs throughout the body, helping them maintain homeostasis, or balance. In doing this, the ECS helps the body regulate such vital functions as appetite, immunity, sleep, pain, stress, memory, motor control, mood, and more.</p>
<p>When you consume CBD, it mimics your body’s endocannabinoids, and signals to those same organs and systems, helping your body maintain homeostasis and regulate all of those important functions. This generates a wealth of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wellness benefits</a> and is the reason CBD has become such a popular health supplement. It’s also the reason many people use <strong>CBD for workouts</strong>.</p>
<h2>CBD for Pre-Workout Energy &amp; Focus</h2>

<h3>CBD for Pain</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Edibles</strong> are one of the most popular ways people enjoy the mood-elevating effects of <strong>delta-9 THC</strong>. And they come in a variety of forms. From <strong>THC gummies</strong> and <strong>THC capsules</strong> to <strong>THC cookies</strong>, <strong>THC brownies</strong> and more, there seems to be an endless selection of these blissful delta-9 treats. And with our hemp-derived delta-9 products, you can enjoy them legally, as well. So, what’s not to love?</p>
<p>Well, there is a classic mistake that many first-timers make when trying <strong>THC edibles</strong>. If you’re one of those looking to make the leap to delta-9 THC, the good news is that you’re on the right page. In this article, we’ll fill you in on what exactly THC edibles are, and clue you in on the mistake many users instantly regret making. We’ll tell you not only how to avoid it, but we’ll also clue you in on some of the <strong>best THC edibles</strong> on the market.</p>
<p>But first things first …</p>
<h2>What Are THC Edibles?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cookies-cbd-wedding-cake/"><img class="alignright wp-image-2120281 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-276x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle d cookies birthday cake  aug  " width="276" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-276x300.jpg 276w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-60x65.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-110x120.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022-300x327.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-d9-cookies-birthday-cake-08-aug-03-2022.jpg 734w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></a>Perhaps it’s a bit obvious, but THC edibles are foods and drinks you can consume containing <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">delta-9 THC</a>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>. THC is a compound found in the cannabis plant. While it has a number of health benefits, THC is best known for the feeling it gives a user when that user has consumed it in greater quantities. That is to say, it’s the thing in cannabis that gets you high.</p>
<p>But not all THC comes from marijuana. There is a low-THC form of cannabis, called hemp, which is used to make a variety of products, from rope to paper — and, of course, legal CBD products. Hemp is regulated by the government under the 2018 US Farm Bill, which states that it can contain up to 0.3% THC. What savvy CBD brands have discovered is that the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum CBD</a>, the oil as it is first extracted from the hemp plant, sometimes has considerably less THC than the legal limit allows. And so, we go back into the full spectrum oil and add bonus amounts of delta-9, taking it back up to the legal limit — giving you a maximum legal THC experience.</p>
<h2>What’s the Classic Edibles Mistake?</h2>
<p>Unlike sublingual oils or vape products, edibles must travel through the digestive tract before being absorbed into the bloodstream. Once the THC and other cannabinoids enter your bloodstream, you’ll begin to feel their effects. The part that trips some people up is that it can take a little longer for edibles to kick in than other forms of THC or CBD products. In fact, depending on <a href="https://cbdfx.com/bioavailability-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters-for-cbd/">bioavailability</a> factors, such as height, weight, body mass, metabolism, and tolerance, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours for you to feel the THC effects.</p>
<p>The classic edibles mistake is impatience. Countless first-timers can attest to getting antsy and thinking they didn’t take enough of their THC product. And so, they take a second or even third dose, in the hopes that things will kick in. Of course, once that first dose does kick in … and the second … and the third … the person can be in way over their head.</p>
<h2>How Can You Avoid It?</h2>
<p>Don’t over-consume. In fact, with your first THC edible, you should consider taking less than the recommended amount to get a sense of your own tolerance. If you wait a couple of hours and find that you’re not really feeling anything, then you’ll know that you can increase your dosage next time around. Not this time … <em>next</em> time. Gently raise your dosage each time out until you find the one that delivers the desired effects. Remember, everyone is different. So your ideal dose isn’t necessarily the same as someone else’s. Start low and gradually work your way up.</p>
<p>And remember, even though this is legal, hemp-derived THC, it can still cause psychotropic effects. So, don’t drive or operate heavy machinery after taking a THC edible.</p>
<h2>The Best THC Edibles You Can Buy</h2>

So, you can trust our products to be the very best in both purity and potency!</p>

<h2>The Final Word on Edibles</h2>
<p>THC and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-guide-to-cbd-edibles-gummies-other-cbd-products/">CBD edibles</a> can be great. In fact, of all the types of hemp-based cannabinoid products, their effects last the longest (potentially six to eight hours!). Just make sure you understand that, just because you don’t feel an edible right away, it doesn’t mean those effects aren’t coming. Don’t get impatient and double dose. Just be cool and enjoy the ride!</p>

Take your favorite drink recipe and add a drop or two of a CBD oil tincture to the mix, so that you can enhance your experience with the flavor and effects of this potent cannabis compound.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of CBD Drinks</h2>
<p>There are multiple benefits to <strong>CBD-infused drinks</strong>, which can vary depending on what kind of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/learn-about-cbd/">CBD</a> hemp extract you choose. All CBD oils come with a plethora of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-benefits-of-cbd/">health benefits</a>, due to CBD&#8217;s interaction with the body&#8217;s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>. But there are certain <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-tincture/">CBD tincture</a> products that are especially designed with wellness in mind. Other CBD hemp products are designed for sleep, making any <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbdfx-kitchen-classics-cbd-smoothie-recipes/"><strong>CBD-infused smoothie</strong></a> or drink a great evening beverage. And there are CBD and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">hemp</a> tinctures designed with blissful relaxation in mind.</p>

<h2>How Are CBD Drinks Made? Choosing the Best CBD Oil</h2>

This popular CBD tincture contains organic, hemp-derived CBD, added CBG for energy, and the powerful antioxidants, curcumin and coenzyme Q10. The flavor of this CBD tincture is citrusy, with just a hint of turmeric. This natural hemp tincture mixes well with juices, smoothies, and most other breakfast or pre-workout beverages.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-focus-mushroom-energy-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1905050" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-300x300.png" alt="cbd tincture focus mushroom" width="156" height="156" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-300x300.png 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-150x150.png 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-768x768.png 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-60x60.png 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-110x110.png 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom-100x100.png 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cbd-tincture-focus-mushroom.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" />Focus Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBG Energy Blend</a> combine wellness-boosting CBD with energizing CBG, plus an array of adaptogenic and nootropic mushrooms, including cordyceps for energy, lion&#8217;s mane for stress, and chaga for<br />
immunity. This incredibly healthy CBD mushroom tincture doesn&#8217;t mix well with a lot of drinks, because of its<br />
pronounced mushroom flavors. But in the right breakfast beverage, it can give a healthful natural energy boost to your day.</p>
<h3>CBD Oils for Chilling Out</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1692849" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx us tinctures calming mg" width="156" height="156" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-us-tinctures-calming-6000mg-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-cbn-oil-tincture-calming-500-4000mg/">CBD + CBN Calming Tincture</a> is a full-spectrum hemp extract that features CBN, also known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” as well as a proprietary blend of restful terpenes. Just watch your intake with this one or you may fall asleep. Like the CBD Wellness Tincture above, CBD Calming Tincture has a citrusy taste, but with notes of pine. If you like to unwind with a relaxing CBD drink at the end of a long day, this might just be the best choice for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1957011" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo render tincture unwind mushroom mar " width="158" height="158" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cbdfx-photo-render-tincture-unwind-mushroom-1000-mar-1-2022.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-unwind-mushroom-relax-blend-drops/">Unwind Mushroom + CBD Drops: CBN Relax Blend</a> also features CBN, along with the stress-busting adaptogens reishi, maitake, and turkey tail, plus antioxidant-rich elderberry. Like the CBD Calming Tincture above, these CBD drops can hit you like a velvet hammer, so be mindful of your intake. Also, understand that this natural CBD mushroom tincture has strong mushroom flavors, so it won&#8217;t work for every beverage.</p>
<h3>CBD Oils for Sleep</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1839048" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx sleep tincture mg" width="170" height="170" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-sleep-tincture-4000mg.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for a true nightcap, a bottle of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-oil-sleep-tincture-500-4000mg/">CBD Sleep Tincture</a> can be just the ticket to dreamland. This powerful CBD tincture contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, CBN, melatonin, and sleep terpenes. The flavor of these potent CBD drops is lemony, which pairs well with some nighttime teas.</p>

<p><i>With all of these CBD oils, please use responsibly. Don&#8217;t drive or operate heavy machinery when using any CBD oils formulated for relaxation. This is particularly true of the THC tinctures. While they contain legal levels of THC, they can cause psychotropic effects. So, tread carefully. Finally — and we cannot stress this enough — do not serve anyone CBD or THC-infused drinks without letting them know what they&#8217;re drinking. </i></p>

<h2>How to Shop for the Best Hemp Oils</h2>
<p>So, you have a great recipe for a sparkling CBD beverage. Now, it&#8217;s time to find the right CBD tincture to add to your drink. Because let&#8217;s face it, your beverage can be as sparkling as can be, and its flavors sparkling, too. But if you don&#8217;t have a pure and potent hemp tincture to add to your drink, there&#8217;s really no point in trying to make an infused CBD beverage … no matter how sparkling it is.</p>
<p>The matter, then, becomes how to find the best CBD products, in terms of both purity and potency. You can begin by only looking for products made with organic cannabis hemp. You don&#8217;t want to be serving beverages that contain pesticides and other toxins, which is exactly what you&#8217;ll be doing if you don&#8217;t choose organically grown CBD. You&#8217;ll also want to make sure your drinks are infused with CBD that has been extracted by means of clean carbon dioxide. CO2 extraction ensures that your CBD doesn&#8217;t retain any residual toxins, as can happen with some solvents that cheaper brands use for CBD extraction.</p>
<p>You can verify the purity and potency of your CBD or THC tincture by looking at the Certificate of Analysis. This is a lab report generated by an independent, third-party company that not only tells you if there are any toxins in your product, but also how much CBD and other cannabinoids are in it, as well. Every reputable CBD company will provide such a report for every product they sell. At CBDfx, we provide a Certificate of Analysis for every product on our website, which can be accessed directly from the product page.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone says “<strong>THC</strong>,” most people have an idea that it’s a term associated with cannabis. Perhaps, they also know that THC is short for <strong>tetrahydrocannabinol</strong>. But did you know that there are different types of THC that have different properties and also differ from one another in terms of state-to-state legality? In this article, we’ll lay out the differences between <strong>delta 8 vs delta 10</strong>, and we’ll brush up on <strong>delta 9 THC</strong>, as well. We’ll cover where these compounds come from and learn some best practices for shopping for <strong>delta 8</strong>, <strong>delta 9</strong>, and <strong>delta 10</strong> THC products. Lastly, we’ll have a look at some of the <strong>best THC products</strong> available in 2022.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the plant that produces all of these fascinating compounds: <strong>cannabis</strong>.</p>
<h2>Cannabis &amp; Cannabinoids</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1861759" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg" alt="Trichomes Why Does Cannabis Produce Cannabinoids" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trichomes-Why-Does-Cannabis-Produce-Cannabinoids.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Cannabis is a hearty plant that thrives in almost any environment, which helps explain why its use became so widespread in the ancient world. For our purposes, we’re going to concentrate on the low-THC type of cannabis called hemp. All of the products we’ll be discussing in this article are derived from hemp and are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill.</p>
<p>All cannabis (hemp and high-THC marijuana) produces chemical compounds on its surface, called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>. Cannabis produces cannabinoids in order to protect the plant against insect predators, grazing animals, and harsh weather conditions. Cannabinoids also attract pollinators, helping the species to continue to thrive.</p>
<h3>The Endocannabinoid System</h3>
<p>Vertebrate animals, including humans, produce their own cannabinoids, which are called endocannabinoids. These are part of an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>, which signals to receptors in various organs and systems throughout the body, helping them to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This interaction helps the body to regulate such vital functions as sleep, appetite, mood, memory, stress, pain, immunity, motor control, and more.</p>
<p>When you take a cannabinoid, like CBD, it mimics your body’s own endocannabinoids, signaling to those same receptors and boosting your body’s ability to maintain homeostasis. It also supports your body’s ability to regulate all those crucial functions we discussed.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta 8 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta 8 is what’s known as a minor cannabinoid. That means, this form of THC occurs in very small quantities in cannabis. Like its more famous cousin, delta 9 THC, delta 8 has psychotropic properties, meaning that it can intoxicate you or get you “high” if you take enough of it.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta 10 THC?</h2>
<p>Delta 10 is also a minor cannabinoid, existing in only the tiniest of quantities in cannabis. This form of THC can also be intoxicating if you take enough of it.</p>
<p>Both delta 8 and delta 10 fall outside the purview of the 2018 US Farm Bill, which allows for the cultivation, manufacture, and distribution of hemp, so long as it contains less than 0.3% delta 9 THC by dry weight. Delta 8 and delta 10 are less regulated, which has allowed some companies to create recreational hemp products with hefty levels of these two cannabinoids.</p>
<h2>Delta 10 vs Delta 8</h2>
<p>Delta 10 and delta 8 THC, as mentioned, are both minor cannabinoids and both can produce psychotropic effects if you take them in great enough quantities. But those effects can differ for some users.</p>
<p>Delta 8 is generally considered to produce the stronger effects of the two. These delta 8 THC effects have been described as euphoric, as is often associated with cannabis sativa strains. One nice thing about delta 8 is that it generally doesn’t produce paranoia or anxiety as sometimes happens with delta 9 THC.</p>
<p>Delta 10 produces euphoric effects, too, albeit at lesser intensity than delta 8 or delta 9 THC. This mild calming effect is great for relieving stress. And like delta 8 THC, delta 10 doesn’t come with paranoia or anxiety effects, as some experience with delta 9 THC.</p>
<h2>What About Delta 9 THC?</h2>
<p>You can’t have a conversation about THC delta products without mentioning delta-9 THC. When people say “<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">THC</a>” or “<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>,” without calling out a specific “delta” in front of it, you can assume they’re talking about delta-9 THC. Delta-9 THC, after all, is a major cannabinoid — one of two major cannabinoids, along with CBD. That means it occurs in high concentrations in cannabis, particularly in marijuana (it’s the one that gets you high). In hemp, delta-9 THC is regulated and must be at a level less than 0.3% dry weight in order to adhere to the 2018 US Farm Bill.</p>
<p>All of the products in our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/">Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC</a> collection, include full spectrum CBD with extra delta-9 THC added back in to take it as close to the legal limit as possible. This allows you to enjoy the maximum legal effects of THC.</p>
<p>Delta-9 THC produces psychotropic effects if you take it in large enough quantities. Depending on the cannabis strain (sativa vs indica vs hybrid), those effects can include mood elevation and creativity, relaxation, and other blissful effects. It’s worth noting, as well, that delta-9 THC also produces a bevy of health benefits, including relief for stress and pain, antihistamine and antioxidant benefits, muscle relaxation, prevention of nausea, and sleep support.</p>
<p>Here’s a handy table for these three THC cannabinoids.</p>

<h2>Shopping for the Best Delta Products</h2>

For starters, it’s important to only shop for products made with organic hemp. Hemp is well known for its ability to absorb everything in the soil that surrounds it. That’s great for taking in nutrients, but bad news if the soil contains pesticides, heavy metals, or other potentially harmful chemicals. It’s also important that the oil is extracted cleanly, as with carbon dioxide. This ensures that no solvent residue ends up in your finished product. You can verify the purity of your CBD or THC product by consulting the third-party lab report (or, Certificate of Analysis) that accompanies your product. This will not only tell you if there are any toxic substances in your product, but it will also tell you exactly how much delta 8, delta 10, or delta 9 THC is in your product.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/delta-9-thc-capsules-cbd-daily-chill-blend/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1955499 " src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules.jpg" alt="cbdfx d thc daily chill blend capsules" width="233" height="233" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cbdfx-d9-thc-daily-chill-blend-capsules-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></a>Once you’ve discovered a brand or two that meets those standards, then you can start thinking in terms of which cannabinoids or other ingredients you’d prefer to have in your product: delta 8 versus delta 9 or delta 10. Perhaps you’d like a combination of multiple types of THC. Here are a few pure and potent options for each.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more hemp products, boasting the word “delta” on the label, have become big sellers in the world of cannabis and CBD enthusiasts. But what does it mean? Most people have heard of <strong>THC</strong>, of course—it’s the cannabis compound that gets you high. But is that <strong>delta 8 THC</strong>? <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/"><strong>Delta 9 THC</strong></a>? <strong>Delta 10 THC</strong>? It almost seems like a scorecard is in order before you shop for <strong>THC products</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, we’re here to give you all the info you’ll ever need on THC and all those delta products. We’ll talk about where THC, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/">CBD</a>, and other cannabinoids come from, and discuss the benefits and effects of each compound. Lastly, you’ll learn how to find the best delta 8 and delta 9 products, so that you can shop with confidence.</p>
<h2>What Are Cannabinoids?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1826884" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg" alt="cbdfx us blog CBD and Friends Exploring Minor Cannabinoids" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-768x456.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-110x65.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cbdfx-us-blog-CBD-and-Friends-Exploring-Minor-Cannabinoids.jpg 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Cannabinoids</a> are chemical compounds produced by the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/">cannabis</a> plant. There are over a hundred cannabinoids found in the legal form of cannabis, called hemp. Hemp differs from marijuana in its delta 9 THC content. Hemp has very low delta 9 THC content (less than 0.3%, by US law), and marijuana has considerably more. The products we’ll be discussing in this article are derived from hemp, and are compliant with the 2018 US Farm Bill. But let’s get back to those cannabinoids.</p>
<p>The cannabis plant produces these compounds in order to ward away insect predators and grazing animals. They also protect cannabis plants from harsh weather and attract pollinators. In short, they’re a lifesaver for cannabis hemp.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Cannabinoids</h2>
<p>As it so happens, your body creates its own cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, which have profound effects on your overall health. Endocannabinoids are part of a cell-signaling system called, you guessed it, the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>. Endocannabinoids send signals to receptors in systems and organs throughout the body to help them maintain homeostasis, or balance. This helps your body to regulate a number of crucial functions, including sleep, motor control, pain management, stress management, mood, appetite, memory, immunity, and more.</p>
<p>When you take a cannabinoid, like CBD, it mimics the body’s own endocannabinoids and helps to bolster these various functions. This is why CBD has become one of the most popular health supplements on the market. Other cannabinoids can have beneficial effects, as well. In fact, we generally think of THC (delta 9) for its intoxicating effects. But as you’ll see in a moment, THC can have beneficial effects for your health, too!</p>

<h2>What Is Delta 8?</h2>
<p>Delta 8 THC is what’s referred to as a “minor cannabinoid.” This is because delta 8 THC only occurs in the very tiniest of amounts in cannabis (certainly in hemp). It has a slightly different chemical structure from delta 9 THC, but delta 8 can still produce psychotropic effects if taken in large enough quantities. Just as with delta 9 THC, delta 8 can produce feelings of relaxation, mood elevation or euphoria, and can potentially help with pain relief. The difference is that delta 8’s effects are milder and less impairing than delta 9’s.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta 9?</h2>
<p>Delta-9 THC is the big boi. When people say “<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-delta-9-thc/">THC</a>” or “<a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>,” without any delta in front of it, you can pretty much assume they’re talking about delta-9 THC. Delta-9 is a major cannabinoid (one of two, along with CBD), meaning that it occurs in large quantities in cannabis, particularly marijuana. The 2018 US Farm Bill legalized the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of hemp products so long as they adhere to the THC limit of less than 0.3% by dry weight. When you see a hemp-derived delta-9 product, as with our <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/full-spectrum-cbd/">Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC</a> collection, you’re getting a product with the delta-9 levels pushed all the way up to the legal limit. This allows you to enjoy the maximum legal effects of THC.</p>
<p>Delta 9 THC absolutely produces psychotropic effects if you take enough of it. Depending on the cannabis strain, those delta-9 effects can include mood elevation and creativity, deep relaxation, and other pleasurable effects. Delta-9 THC also produces a wealth of health benefits, including relief for stress and pain, antihistamine and antioxidant benefits, prevention of nausea, muscle relaxation, and sleep support.</p>
<h2>What Is Delta 10?</h2>
<p>Like delta 8 THC, delta 10 is a minor cannabinoid that occurs in very small amounts in the cannabis plant (even less so in hemp). And like delta 8, delta 10 THC also produces a slightly subdued high (at least compared to delta 9 THC) if taken in large enough doses.</p>
<h2>What About CBD, CBN, and Other Cannabinoids?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1842023" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids.jpg" alt="what are Phytocannabinoids" width="155" height="259" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids.jpg 719w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-180x300.jpg 180w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-613x1024.jpg 613w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-60x100.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-110x184.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/what-are-Phytocannabinoids-300x501.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 155px) 100vw, 155px" />Most cannabinoids are non-intoxicating, and many of these cannabis compounds come with a wealth of health benefits. CBD (cannabidiol) is the most famous of these cannabinoids and is the star player in most hemp products. CBD produces a number of health benefits, due to its interaction with the body’s endocannabinoid system. CBD also has gentle calming effects that make it a great ingredient for calming the mind and providing focus in energy products, and make it a potent ingredient for many relaxation and sleep products.</p>
<p>Some notable minor cannabinoids include CBG (cannabigerol), commonly known as the “Mother of All Cannabinoids,” because other cannabinoids are derived from its acidic form. CBG benefits include pain relief and anti-inflammatory benefits, plus energy. CBN (cannabinol) is known as the “ultimate relaxation cannabinoid,” due to its deep sleep properties. CBC (cannabichromene) is believed to help with inflammation, pain, swelling, and depression.</p>
<p>Here’s a helpful table to help you remember your cannabinoids.</p>

<h2>Shopping for Delta-based THC Products</h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-1989597 alignright" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar.jpg" alt="WHAT IS DELTA THC sidebar" width="361" height="361" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar.jpg 838w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-110x110.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/WHAT-IS-DELTA-9-THC-sidebar-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" />There are a number of factors to consider when <a href="https://cbdfx.com/delta-9-thc-product-guide-thc-gummies-oils-vapes-more/">choosing a THC product</a>. Foremost among them are purity and potency. In terms of purity with any cannabis or hemp product, organic farming is a must. This is because of cannabis’ propensity for soaking in everything from the soil that surrounds it, including pesticides and other potentially harmful chemicals. You’ll also want to shop with brands that use clean hemp oil extraction methods, such as carbon dioxide extraction, in order to avoid any solvent residues left behind in your oil. You can verify all of this by checking for an independent, third-party lab report (or, Certificate of Analysis), that will tell you exactly how much THC, CBD, and other cannabinoid content is in your product, as well as any toxins that may be present.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a few brands that meet those standards, then you can begin to think in terms of which cannabinoids or other ingredients you’d like to see in your product. Are you looking for a delta 8 THC product? Delta 9? Perhaps you’d like to see a well-rounded THC product with delta 8 and delta 9 THC … and maybe even delta 10 THC, for good measure. Here are a few safe and effective options for each.</p>
<p>At CBDfx, we offer a massive line of Full Spectrum CBD + Delta-9 THC products, including <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-delta-9-thc-gummies-berry-buzz-sativa/">delta-9 THC gummies</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/delta-9-thc-capsules-cbd-daily-chill-blend/">delta-9 THC capsules</a>, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/thc-oil-tinctures/">delta-9 THC oil tinctures</a>, Delta-9 THC Edibles (including a tasty <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/thc-cookies-cbd-wedding-cake/">delta-9 THC cookie</a> and a delightful Delta-9 THC brownie), <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/thc-vape-pens/">delta-9 THC vape pens</a>, and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/thc-vape-juice/">delta-9 THC vape juice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people have heard of CBD, and rightfully so, given this hemp compound’s many benefits, which have spawned an entire industry of health and wellness products. But </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbg/"><b>CBG</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be just as important for daily wellness and other applications, including relief for aches and pains. But just what is CBG and how does it work? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’ll take a closer look at the compound formally known as cannabigerol, examining where it comes from and how it affects the human body. We’ll also take a look at how </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbg-cbd-cream-for-muscle-joint-heating-formula-11-ratio/"><b>CBG pain cream</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products can help you deal with muscle and joint pain, as well as inflammation and related issues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, let’s learn more about this fascinating compound.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is CBG?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CBG (</span><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/cannabigerol-cbg-uses-and-benefits-5085266"><b>cannabigerol</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is one of a group of compounds created by the cannabis plant, called </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These compounds protect the plant from insect predators and grazing animals, as well as harsh elements of the weather. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also attract pollinators, which help to perpetuate the species.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG is commonly referred to as the “Mother of All Cannabinoids,” because its acidic form (CBGA) is a precursor for CBD and many other cannabinoids. CBGA interacts with enzymes within the plant to create CBD, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-thc-a-guide-to-tetrahydrocannabinol/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, the form of cannabis used to create the CBD and CBG products on this site is </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cannabis-vs-hemp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a low-THC form of cannabis. As such, our CBD and CBG products cannot get you high. But they can deliver a variety of benefits. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can CBG Help With Pain?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1896692" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--300x164.jpg" alt="What Is the Best CBD Cream for Pain " width="300" height="164" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--300x164.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--1024x559.jpg 1024w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--768x419.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--60x33.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--110x60.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-Is-the-Best-CBD-Cream-for-Pain--2048x1117.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />CBD, CBG, and other cannabinoids interact with the body’s </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endocannabinoid system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This system is composed of neurotransmitters, called endocannabinoids, and receptors that occur in a variety of the body’s organs and systems, including the brain and the nervous system. These endocannabinoids signal to the various receptors and help those organs and systems to maintain homeostasis, or balance. This, in turn, helps the body to regulate such crucial functions as sleep, appetite, pain, stress, mood, memory, motor control, immune function, and more. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1897051" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-130x300.jpg" alt="endocannabinoid system" width="130" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-130x300.jpg 130w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-445x1024.jpg 445w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-768x1766.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-60x138.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-110x253.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-668x1536.jpg 668w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system-300x690.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/endocannabinoid-system.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px" />CBD and its cannabinoid cousins mimic the body’s own endocannabinoids, when consumed, and help to bolster this system, supporting homeostasis and improving the body’s ability to regulate many of these aforementioned functions. This creates a bevy of health and wellness benefits, which is why so many people have turned to CBD, CBG, and other hemp compounds in health supplements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for cannabigerol and its ability to help with muscle and joint issues, CBG binds with CB1 and CB2 receptors, positively affecting the function of anandamide, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in alleviating pain, as well as delivering benefits for mood, appetite, and sleep. Like CBD, cannabigerol has anti-inflammatory benefits, as well. CBG research is still ongoing, but because of these commonly observed benefits, it’s already become a highly sought-after pain cream ingredient.</span></p>

While there are certainly a lot of brands and products to choose from, many of those CBD brands sell substandard and even unsafe products. Here are a few criteria to keep in mind as you shop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/is-hemp-good-for-the-planet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is what’s known as a bioaccumulator, meaning that it is extremely efficient at absorbing things from the soil. This makes it incredibly important that you find CBD and CBG products made with organic hemp, so that you don’t risk having pesticides and other toxins in your product. It’s also important to shop for products that contain hemp oil that has been extracted with clean carbon dioxide. </span><a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-oil-co2-extraction-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CO2 oil extraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eliminates the potential for harmful residues, as can result from cheaper methods of extraction. And you’ll want to see a third-party lab report to confirm the purity of your product, as well as the potency. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
