										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our <b>skin</b> provides a hardy and protective covering for our bodies. It can be supple and flexible, yet durable and resilient. There’s no overstating just how important our skin is to our overall wellness. But skin can also suffer from conditions that wear away at its health. Dryness, <b>acne</b>, and <b>wrinkling</b> are all common skin issues we eventually have to deal with.</p>
<p>Recently, <b>CBD</b> has become a popular ingredient in <b>skin-care products</b>, due to its anti-inflammatory properties and other potential benefits stemming from its interaction with the body’s endocannabinoid system. Research on the subject is relatively recent, and we’re learning new things every day on the topic of <b>CBD and skin health</b>.</p>
<p>But the question remains: Can <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> help with common <b>skin conditions</b>? Let’s explore the world of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> and skin health.</p>
<h2>CBD, the Endocannabinoid System, and Skin Health</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1612475 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg" alt="what is cbd endocannabinoids system" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a> is a system common to all vertebrates. The ECS helps to regulate several of the body’s most crucial functions, including sleep, mood, memory, pain, inflammation, stress, appetite, and many others. It does so through neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids bind to the body’s CB1 and CB2 receptors, sending signals as it does so to systems throughout the body to help them maintain homeostasis, or balance.</p>
<p>One group of such receptors these endocannabinoids trigger are called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240254/">cutaneous ionotropic cannabinoid receptors</a>. These receptors affect such functions as pain and itch perception, epidermal homeostasis, and the promotion and suppression of dermatitis, which is the inflammation of the skin. By helping to maintain balance in these functions, these endocannabinoids go a long way toward preserving the health of the skin.</p>
<p>CBD, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-does-cbd-stand-for-a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">cannabidiol</a>, is one of a group of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a> produced by the cannabis plant. Plant-based cannabinoids, or phytocannabinoids, actually protect the surface of the plant from the elements, as well as insect pests. They also attract pollinators, which helps to perpetuate the species. Strangely enough, CBD and its fellow phytocannabinoids have a similar effect to endocannabinoids, when introduced into the body. They, too, signal to receptors in the nervous system and other systems to maintain homeostasis. As it turns out, that includes the aforementioned cutaneous ionotropic cannabinoid receptors. This is what makes the potential of CBD in skin-care products so intriguing.</p>
<h3>CBD vs. THC</h3>
<p>CBD is one of two major <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a> — that is, cannabinoids that exist in high quantities in the cannabis plant. The other major cannabinoid is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cannabidiol-cbd-vs-thc/">THC</a>, which is commonly known for being the cannabinoid that gets you high. Because CBD products use CBD derived from a low-THC version of the cannabis plant, called the hemp plant, they cannot get you high. In fact, a majority of CBDfx’s products are made from broad spectrum CBD oil, which is oil that has undergone an extra filtering process to remove even the tiny traces of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-101-cbd-vs-thc-whats-the-difference/">THC</a> that exist in the hemp plant. But even if you get a full spectrum product, which makes use of all of the hemp plant’s oil, the amount of THC is still so low (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-much-thc-is-in-cbd-oil/">less than 0.3%</a>) that <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cbd-does-cbd-get-you-high/">it is non-intoxicating</a>.</p>
<h2>The Use of CBD for Skin Conditions</h2>
<p>There has been a <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cbd-oil-for-skin#does-it-work">great deal of research</a> in recent years on how CBD can be used for skin conditions. It should be noted that the FDA has not yet approved the use of CBD for medical applications, so nothing that we say here should be construed as a medical recommendation — because we simply aren’t allowed to make such claims. However, I would like to show you some of these studies, so that you can make an informed decision on your own (or in consultation with your licensed dermatologist).</p>
<h3>CBD for Acne</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1804770 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx face masks" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cbdfx-photo-render-face-mask-charcoal-apr-07-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324689#does-it-work">Studies have concluded</a> that CBD can be helpful in preventing and lessening the effects of acne. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4151231/">Research suggests</a> that it does so by regulating the body’s production of sebum, the oily substance generated by the skin. Overproduction of sebum can lead to clogged pores and result in acne. By maintaining homeostasis (balance), overproduction of sebum can be prevented or, at least, minimized. This same study revealed that CBD’s <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/">anti-inflammatory</a> properties prevent cytokines (cell-signalling proteins that can trigger acne) from activating, helping to reduce future breakouts, as well.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/">CBD Charcoal Face Mask</a> can be particularly useful in delivering organic CBD to an area affected by acne, as well as cleansing charcoal.</p>
<h3>CBD for Irritation, Dryness and Itching</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429381/">A separate study</a> concluded that CBD can potentially be useful in the treatment of irritation, dryness, and itching in the skin. As an anti-inflammatory, CBD can potentially be used to reduce the triggers of <b>dermatitis</b>, <b>eczema</b>, and <b>psoriasis</b>. This could be particularly useful for people with sensitive skin, prone to constant irritation and inflammation.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1710263 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx us balm stick soothing formula calming moisturizing mg" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>A <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/">CBD Calming and Moisturizing Balm Stick</a> can be particularly useful in this regard in areas other than the face (where you may want to stick with a face mask). This handy balm stick delivers <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, combined with moisturizing shea butter and Roman chamomile oil, plus soothing botanicals, like lavender, tea tree and vetiver oils, and hemp seed oil.</p>
<p>Hemp seed oil is different from CBD oil, which is rendered from the buds, leaves and stems of the hemp plant. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-difference-between-cbd-oil-hemp-seed-oil/">Hemp seed oil</a> doesn’t contain cannabinoids, like CBD, but it does have a host of other properties that are beneficial for the skin.</p>
<h3>CBD for Aging and Wrinkling Skin</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1819929 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-200x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx photo lifestyle facemask feb " width="200" height="300" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-60x90.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-110x165.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021-300x450.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-photo-lifestyle-facemask-04-feb-24-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/">One study</a> found that CBD’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties helped to combat <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927356/">oxidative stress</a>, which can make the skin look older and more wrinkled. This certainly calls to mind the potential benefits of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/">CBD Face Masks</a>, which evenly distribute 50mg of organic, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a> (plus <a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-you-need-a-cbd-face-mask/">other skin nutrients, like aloe vera or cucumber</a>) across the face.</p>
<h3>CBD for Infection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740396/">Research has shown</a> that CBD may have antifungal and antibacterial properties. This may prove useful in treating some minor infections. Nevertheless, you should still consult your physician if you believe you have a skin infection.</p>
<h2>CBD and Skin Health</h2>
<p>As you’ve seen, research is revealing a great deal of potential for CBD in dealing with many common skin conditions. There’s still a great deal of work to be done, but it is promising. I encourage you to read up on this topic and check in here from time to time, as well, as we post helpful articles about CBD and skin health. It’s important to stay informed.

					<description><![CDATA[We all want softer, healthier skin. It not only helps us look better, but it’s good for our health, as well. The skin is the body’s largest [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all want softer, healthier skin. It not only helps us look better, but it’s good for our health, as well. The skin is the body’s largest organ, and we need to treat it with the love and care it deserves. That’s why everyone should have a good <b>skin-care routine</b>.</p>
<p>A skin-care routine has many components, from washing to moisturizing to using a good sunscreen. <b>CBD</b> can help, too. <b>Cannabidiol</b> is an underrated <b>skin-care product</b>, because it works in concert with the body’s <b>endocannabinoid system</b>. Why is this important for your skin? Let’s take a look at what CBD is, how it works with the body, and the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">potential benefits of CBD</a> for the health of your skin.</p>
<h2>Cannabinoids and CBD</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1848688" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-238x300.jpg" alt="balmstick " width="172" height="217" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-238x300.jpg 238w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-813x1024.jpg 813w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-768x967.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-60x76.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-110x139.jpg 110w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521-300x378.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/balmstick-082521.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" /><a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-does-cbd-stand-for-a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">Cannabidiol</a> (or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a>, for short) is one of a group of chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant, called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a>. <b>Cannabinoids</b> actually protect the “skin” of the cannabis plant, as they are secreted on the surface of the plant by glands called trichomes. From there, the cannabinoids protect the plant from the elements and insect predators. They also attract pollinators. As skin-care routines go, cannabis has a pretty good one going.</p>
<h3>A Quick Note on Cannabis and CBD</h3>
<p>Let me take a quick aside to explain what we’re talking about when I refer to cannabis and CBD. Cannabis can be broken down into two groups, at least according to the law. Cannabis with a large amount of <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-101-cbd-vs-thc-whats-the-difference/">THC</a>, the cannabinoid that gets you high, is called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-difference-between-marijuana-cbd-and-hemp-cbd/">marijuana</a>. Cannabis with low, non-intoxicating amounts of THC (<a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-much-thc-is-in-cbd-oil/">less than 0.3%</a>) is called hemp. While CBD exists in both types of cannabis, CBD products — at least, the ones that don’t come from a dispensary — are derived from the hemp plant. So, to be clear, the CBD we’re talking about using for skin care is hemp-derived and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-cbd-does-cbd-get-you-high/">will not get you high</a>.</p>
<h2>CBD and the Endocannabinoid System</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1612475 size-medium" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg" alt="what is cbd endocannabinoids system" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-300x178.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x-60x36.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-is-cbd-endocannabinoids-system@2x.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Now that we have that straight, let’s talk about how these little plant protectors can positively affect the human body. All vertebrates — ourselves included — have an <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoid system</a>. This system helps the body to maintain balance in several of its systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, among others. The body produces little neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids — that’s right, your body makes its own cannabinoids! These endocannabinoids attach to receptors in the nervous system and other systems, and send a signal to those systems to help regulate them. This affects a variety of functions, including sleep, mood, memory, appetite, motor control, pain, stress, and more.</p>
<p>Among the receptors that endocannabinoids trigger is a group called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240254/">cutaneous ionotropic cannabinoid receptors</a>. These receptors affect pain and itch perception, epidermal homeostasis (that is, balance), and the promotion and suppression of dermatitis, which is the inflammation of the skin.</p>
<p>CBD and other cannabinoids have a similar effect on the body when consumed. Like the body’s own endocannabinoids, these plant-based cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) also signal to the body’s receptors and spur the body’s systems into action. Some <a href="https://cbdfx.com/cbd-and-friends-exploring-minor-cannabinoids/">cannabinoids</a> have a very specific effect. CBN, for instance, works to balance the body’s sleep function, making it an incredibly effective natural sleep supplement. CBD is more of an all-around compound, helping the body to maintain homeostasis in a number of different areas — which is what has made it such a popular wellness product.</p>
<p>And it is believed that one of the receptors CBD triggers is, in fact, the cutaneous ionotropic cannabinoid receptors we mentioned earlier. So, as a skin-care product, CBD has remarkable potential.</p>
<h3>A Quick Note About CBD Oil and Hemp Seed Oil</h3>
<p>Before we get into CBD skin-care products, let’s make one more distinction. CBD oil is the oil derived from the buds, seeds and stalks of the hemp plant. You might see CBD oil referred to as hemp oil. That gets confusing, though, because there’s also something called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-difference-between-cbd-oil-hemp-seed-oil/">hemp seed oil</a>. Hemp seed oil doesn’t contain the cannabinoids, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-terpenes-lets-talk-about-it/">terpenes</a> and other goodies you see in CBD oil, but it does have its own benefits for skin. Hemp seed oil is actually rich in essential amino acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, plus wellness-boosting vitamin E — and has been found to have beneficial effects on <b>skin conditions</b> and anti-aging. But again, if you’re looking for the wellness benefits of CBD, you won’t find them in hemp seed oil.</p>
<p>One other bit of confusion can come in the packaging you see in some hemp products. In fact, some unscrupulous hemp seed oil manufacturers will market it as hemp oil, hoping that you won’t know the difference. Don’t be fooled. Any reputable CBD company will have a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">third-party lab report</a> available for every product they sell. Take a look and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-ways-to-make-sure-you-buy-real-cbd-online/">make sure you’re getting CBD</a> in your oil!</p>
<p>I know, I know. When are we going to get to the skin-care routine?! Let’s get to it.</p>
<h2>CBD Products for Your Skin-Care Routine</h2>
<p>There are different ways you can use CBD. CBD products, like edibles, vapes, and sublinguals, are absorbed into the bloodstream. CBD topicals, on the other hand, are absorbed into the skin and work directly on the affected area. We’re going to look at some CBD topical products that you can use in your regular skin-care routine.</p>
<h3>CBD Masks</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1820333 size-full" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2.jpg" alt="cbdfx face mask" width="800" height="160" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2.jpg 800w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2-300x60.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2-768x154.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2-60x12.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cbdfx-face-mask2-110x22.jpg 110w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/">CBD Face Masks</a> combine organic, broad spectrum CBD with other active ingredients, each with its own benefits for the skin. I try to have some of each on hand, so that I have some flexibility in selecting the most appropriate face mask for my needs on a particular day. The CBD Rose Face Mask is specially formulated for toning and moisturizing. The CBD Charcoal Face Mask is great for purifying and brightening. The CBD Aloe Vera Mask is a favorite of mine for soothing and tightening the skin. The CBD Lavender Face Mask is helpful for relaxing and soothing. And the CBD Cucumber Face Mask is wonderful for hydrating and tightening. With a CBD face mask, your skin can feel softer and healthier in as little as 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And remember, a good skin-care routine doesn’t just apply to the face. The skin on other parts of your body need soothing relief as well, especially the feet! This area is often over stressed and worn down from the wear and tear of the day. A good <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-masks-lavender-peppermint-50mg/">CBD Foot Mask</a> can rejuvenate achy feet and revitalize the skin. With broad spectrum CBD oil and active botanicals, a CBD Foot Mask can soften your feet and have them feeling fresh and new.</p>
<h3>CBD Creams</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1266795" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx foot cream restoring detoxifying lavender 500mg" width="217" height="217" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cbdfx-foot-cream-restoring-detoxifying-500mg.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></a>Another great skin product for your feet is <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/">CBD Foot Cream</a>, which includes several ingredients that can work on stressed skin, as well as the aches and pains in the muscles and joints beneath. Combining softening shea butter, soothing essential oils and terpenes, along with <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, CBD Foot Cream can be just the thing you need to bring the dry, irritated skin of your feet back to life.</p>
<h3>CBD Balms</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/"><img class="wp-image-1710263 alignright" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx us balm stick soothing formula calming moisturizing mg" width="217" height="217" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cbdfx-us-balm-stick-soothing-formula-calming-moisturizing-3000mg.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></a>CBD balms are denser than creams and remain more on the surface of the skin (whereas a water-based cream sinks through to the muscles and tissues beneath). Because the balm remains on the skin, it allows the CBD to work harder on the upper dermal layers. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/">CBD Calming and Moisturizing Balm Stick</a> not only contains <a href="https://cbdfx.com/breaking-down-full-spectrum-broad-spectrum-and-cbd-isolate/">broad spectrum CBD</a>, but also moisturizing shea butter and Roman chamomile oil, plus soothing botanicals, like lavender, tea tree and vetiver oils. It also contains the aforementioned hemp seed oil. With all of these ingredients working together, the CBD Calming and Moisturizing Balm Stick renews and rejuvenates the skin, soothing irritation and inflammation along the way.</p>
<h3>CBD Bath Bombs</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1806291" src="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-300x300.jpg" alt="cbdfx bath bombs" width="217" height="217" srcset="https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-100x100.jpg 100w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021-60x60.jpg 60w, https://cbdfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cbdfx-photo-render-bath-bomb-combined-apr-07-2021.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/">CBD Bath Bombs</a> allow you to immerse your entire body in wellness-boosting CBD, plus a host of essential oils and other active ingredients, including Hawaiian black salt. While it will certainly do wonders for your muscles and joints (not to mention relaxing your mental state), a CBD Bath Bomb can also be just the thing to pamper the skin over your entire body.</p>
<h2>Making CBD a Part of Your Skin-Care Routine</h2>
<p>A good skin-care routine can have several components, and can include cleanser, toner, serum and many more essential products. CBD can also help you to moisturize and rejuvenate your skin. With masks, balms, creams and other CBD products available, you have a veritable arsenal of skin care at your fingertips. Just make sure you buy quality CBD products, from a <a href="https://cbdfx.com/5-reasons-people-choose-cbdfx-products/">trusted brand</a>, who uses organic ingredients and <a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/">clean CO2 extraction</a> for their CBD. You’ll know these brands because they provide third-party lab reports for all of their products, so that you know you’re getting all the CBD you’ve been promised, and none of the pesticides, solvents, heavy metals, and other harmful chemicals found in cheaper brands. Make sure you give your skin the healthy, effective care it deserves!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few years now, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/understanding-cannabidiol-what-does-cbd-do/">CBD</a> has been one of the hottest wellness products on the market. You see it in everything from sleep and calming products to focus, general wellness and pain management products. And if you’ve been paying attention, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">CBD</a> has also become a very popular ingredient in <b>skin-care products</b>. To understand why this cannabinoid has become so popular for <b>skin care</b>, perhaps we should begin by explaining just what CBD is and how it works.</p>
<h2>The Skinny on CBD (Cannabidiol)</h2>
<p><b>CBD</b>, or <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-does-cbd-stand-for-a-beginners-guide-to-cbd/">cannabidiol</a>, is a chemical compound found in the <b>cannabis</b> plant. It’s one of a group of compounds called <b>cannabinoids</b>. Cannabinoids, like CBD, actually serve as skin care for the plant itself. There are glands on the surface of the plant, called trichomes, which secrete cannabinoids to protect the cannabis plant against the elements and insect predators, as well attract pollinators.</p>
<p>While these plant-based cannabinoids, or <b>phytocannabinoids</b>, are great for the cannabis plant, they also have remarkable benefits for animals. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770351/">All animals have an endocannabinoid system</a>, which brings homeostasis, or balance, to many of the body’s other systems. The body produces its own cannabinoids, called <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system/">endocannabinoids</a>, which interact with receptors in the body’s other systems and, in doing so, help the body to regulate such functions as sleep, pain, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-are-antioxidants-and-anti-inflammatories/">inflammation</a>, mood, memory, and much more.</p>
<p>Phytocannabinoids, such as CBD, act very much the same way. When consumed, the cannabinoids interact with these receptors, which then send messages to the body’s various systems to get working. Different cannabinoids have different specialties, in terms of their effects. CBN, for instance, is a cannabinoid that affects the nervous system in such a way that it relaxes the body for sleep. CBD has broader applications. It supports the body in a broad range of functions, making it sort of a Swiss Army knife as a wellness product.</p>
<h2>CBD for Skin Care | Hemp vs. Marijuana</h2>
<p>Since we’re throwing around the word “cannabis” here quite a bit, I just wanted to take a moment to differentiate the kind of plant we’re talking about when it comes to <b>CBD skin products</b>. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/the-difference-between-marijuana-cbd-and-hemp-cbd/">Marijuana</a> is the word we use to describe cannabis plants with large amounts of THC (the cannabinoid that people use to get high). CBD skin products, in general, are produced by the hemp plant, which is cannabis with low, non-intoxicating amounts of THC in it. So, in no way will the <b>CBD skin-care products</b> we are talking about get you high.</p>
<h2>CBD for Skin Care | Hemp Oil vs. Hemp Seed Oil</h2>
<p>We should also make one more distinction. When we talk about CBD oil, we’re talking about oil derived from the buds, leaves and stalks of the hemp plant. Sometimes referred to as hemp oil, this is different from hemp seed oil, which is somewhat self-explanatory. It’s derived from the seeds of the hemp plant.</p>
<p>One way to tell if you’re getting the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/whats-the-difference-between-cbd-oil-hemp-seed-oil/">right type of oil</a> is to look for terms like <a href="https://cbdfx.com/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-vs-cbd-isolate/">full spectrum, broad spectrum and isolate</a>. These refer to oils derived from the hemp plant’s buds, seeds and stems, but with different levels of filtering. If you see one of these terms in the ingredients, you should have legit CBD oil and not hemp seed oil.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that hemp seed oil doesn’t have its own benefits, as well. In fact, <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hemp-seed-oil-vs-cbd-oil#hemp-seed-oil">the oil derived from hemp seeds</a> is rich in essential amino acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, plus wellness-boosting vitamin E. It does not contain any cannabinoids, though. Still, hemp seed oil has been found to have beneficial effects on <b>skin conditions</b> and anti-aging.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to CBD, skin care and the <b>endocannabinoid system</b>.</p>
<h2>Does the Endocannabinoid System Affect Your Skin?</h2>
<p>We mentioned the receptors that endocannabinoids trigger in various systems of the body. One group of such receptors are called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240254/">cutaneous ionotropic cannabinoid receptors</a>. These receptors affect such functions as pain and itch perception, epidermal homeostasis (that is, balance), and the promotion and suppression of dermatitis, which is the inflammation of the skin.</p>
<p>You’re probably starting to connect the dots, right? If the endocannabinoid system helps to regulate various functions of the skin, and cannabinoids (most notably, CBD) stimulate the endocannabinoid system, then it’s easy to deduce that CBD has the potential to be a valuable tool for skin care.</p>
<h2>Does CBD Help With Psoriasis, Acne, and Eczema?</h2>
<p>This is where I need to step back and make a couple of quick notes about what we can and can’t say about CBD. The FDA has not approved CBD for medical use — not yet, anyway. Study on CBD is still fairly young and there are a number of tests that need to be done before the FDA can give a stamp of approval on using CBD medicinally. This means that I cannot, legally, recommend CBD for medicinal use on <b>skin conditions</b> like <b>psoriasis</b>, <b>acne</b>, <b>eczema</b>, and so forth. All I can do is tell you how it is being studied, and how people are using it.</p>
<h2>What Is a CBD Topical?</h2>
<p>A topical is a product that is rubbed onto a localized area of the body, and sinks into the skin. Unlike CBD edibles or CBD vapes, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/collections/cbd-topicals/">CBD topicals</a> are absorbed by the skin itself, and not absorbed into the bloodstream. You can usually experience the effects of a <b>CBD topical</b> fairly quickly, after just a few minutes. And the effects can last up to six hours. Of course, there are variable factors at play, as well, including your own physiology. We’re all different and react to various chemicals differently. So, if you’re going to experiment with CBD for skin, try it out on a small patch of your affected area and see how you react. Then, add more, if necessary. The nice thing about a CBD topical is that you can’t really overdo it by reapplying a CBD cream or CBD balm. There are no real adverse side effects to worry about on CBD topicals, unless you’re the rare person who is allergic. But again, try a small patch first to make sure everything is okay.</p>
<h2>Types of CBD Skin Care Products</h2>
<p>Now that we know the science behind using CBD for skin care, let’s take a look at some of the different CBD skin products that are available.</p>
<h3>CBD Creams</h3>
<p>Water-based creams enter the pores and penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin, down to the tissue below. This is great for a product like <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-hemp-cream/">CBD Muscle and Joint Cream: Cooling Formula</a>, that gives relief for aches and pains, but is not necessarily a skin-care product.</p>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-cream-lavender-500mg/">CBD Foot Cream</a> does have several ingredients that can work on stressed skin, as well as the aches and pains in the muscles and joints beneath. Combining softening shea butter, soothing essential oils and terpenes, along with broad spectrum CBD, CBD foot cream can be just the thing you need to bring the dry, irritated skin of your feet back to life.</p>
<h3>CBD Balms</h3>
<p>CBD balms, on the other hand, are denser and remain more on the surface of the skin. This gives the CBD a chance to work harder on the upper layers of skin. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-calming-balm/">CBD Calming and Moisturizing Balm Stick</a> not only makes use of broad spectrum CBD, but also moisturizing shea butter and Roman chamomile oil, as well as soothing botanicals, like lavender, tea tree and vetiver oils — plus, the aforementioned hemp seed oil. With all of these ingredients working together, the CBD balm renews and rejuvenates the skin, soothing irritation and inflammation as it does so.</p>
<h3>CBD Masks</h3>
<p>CBD masks are nice because they give you a bit of that “spa day” feel. I always feel a little pampered with a nice mask. <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-face-mask/">CBD face masks</a> can combine organic CBD with other active ingredients, each with its own effects for the skin: rose for toning and moisturizing, charcoal for purifying and brightening, aloe vera for soothing and tightening, lavender for relaxing and soothing, and cucumber for hydrating and tightening. With a CBD face mask, your skin can feel softer and healthier in as little as 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Many of the same ingredients that make CBD balms and face masks work so well on the skin can do wonders on the skin of the feet. This area is often over stressed and worn down. A good <a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-foot-masks-lavender-peppermint-50mg/">CBD foot mask</a> can rejuvenate achy feet and revitalize the skin. With broad spectrum CBD oil and active botanicals, it can soften your feet and have them feeling fresh and new.</p>
<h3>CBD Bath Bombs</h3>
<p><a href="https://cbdfx.com/products/cbd-bath-bombs/">Bath bombs</a> allow you to immerse your entire body in wellness-boosting CBD, plus a host of essential oils and other active ingredients, like Hawaiian black salt. While it will certainly do wonders for your muscles and joints (not to mention relaxing your mental state), a CBD bath bomb can also be just the thing to pamper the skin over your entire body.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right CBD Skin Care Product</h2>
<p>Whatever CBD product you choose, there’s one important factor you should always keep in mind, and that’s quality. There are countless cheaply made CBD skin-care products on the market, with insufficient or impure active ingredients, packed with all sorts of toxins. It’s important to find a company that sells only CBD derived from organic hemp, <a href="https://cbdfx.com/why-co2-extraction-matters-for-your-wellness/">processed without harmful solvents</a>, and complemented with quality ingredients. Make sure to look for third-party <a href="https://cbdfx.com/how-to-read-a-lab-report/">lab reports</a>, which should be available for any CBD product sold by a reputable company. This report will tell you the purity and potency of your product, and can warn you away from substandard CBD products, as well. You can also check customer reviews to see what other people are saying about a skin-care product. It’s your skin, you want to make sure that you’re only feeding it ingredients of the <a href="https://cbdfx.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-cbd-brand/">highest quality</a>.</p>
<h2>CBD and Skin Care</h2>
<p>Research is still in the early stages for CBD and its potential uses as a skin-care product. But there are a lot of exciting products available, and it’s worth having a look. I hope that this guide will help you on your journey.</p>
