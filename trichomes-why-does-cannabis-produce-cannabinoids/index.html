Trichomes are just one of the multitude of biological superpowers that we find in cannabis.\r\n\r\nWhat are trichomes, what do they do, and why should we care?\r\n\r\nWell, among a zillion other things, trichomes produce the cannabinoids, like CBD, that we benefit from when we use CBD products. But that\u2019s just the beginning.\u00a0\r\n\r\nToday, we\u2019ll take a deep dive into trichomes and cannabinoids, but first \u2026\r\nCannabis, Hemp, and Marijuana\r\nWe\u2019re throwing around the term \u201ccannabis\u201d a great deal, so it\u2019s worth having a quick word about the type of cannabis plants we\u2019re discussing today. The law divides cannabis into two categories: cannabis hemp and cannabis marijuana. Hemp is cannabis that contains only tiny trace amounts of the cannabinoid THC (less than 0.3%). This makes hemp-derived products, like our CBD products, non-intoxicating. Cannabis with more THC is called marijuana. When we refer to the cannabis used in our CBD products, we are not talking about marijuana.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll good? Okay, on to the trichomes!\r\nWhat Are Trichomes?\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever looked closely at a cannabis plant, you\u2019ve likely noticed something that looks like a fine frost covering the flowers and leaves, if not most of the plant. These are called trichomes and, just like practically every part of the incredible cannabis plant, they serve a wide range of valuable purposes.\r\n\r\nMost trichomes can only be seen in detail through a microscope, but these infinitesimal wonders are responsible for not only protecting the cannabis plant, but also producing the cannabinoids and other molecular compounds that make cannabis the beneficial and versatile plant that it is.\r\n\r\nTrichomes may look like crystals, but they\u2019re actually organic growths that appear on a huge range of plants and algae, including trees, vegetables, and fruit.\r\n\r\nTheir name comes from the Greek word trichoma, which means hair, and that\u2019s just what most hemp trichomes look like from a distance. However, if we zoom in, we see that there are three distinct types of trichomes found on hemp plants, and they do different things.\r\nBulbous Trichomes\r\nBulbous trichomes are the smallest of all the cannabis trichomes. They appear on the entire plant and provide the sticky quality of the flowers.\r\nCapitate Sessile Trichomes\r\nCapitate sessile trichomes are slightly larger trichomes, and are made up of a stalk with a head, giving it a tiny mushroom appearance. They look a little like characters from an animated Miyazaki film. These little guys are responsible for the biosynthesis of cannabinoids and terpenes, among other things.\r\nCapitate-Stalked Trichomes\r\nThe largest trichomes, and the only ones you can observe well with the naked eye, capitate-stalked trichomes are the most abundant of the cannabis trichomes. They appear mostly on the flowers. Capitate-stalked trichomes create resin, and have the highest concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes.\u00a0\r\nTrichome Development in Cannabis\r\nAs the cannabis hemp plant grows and develops, so do its trichomes. Gradually, trichomes produce the precursors to cannabinoids, along with the other powerful phytochemicals they make to protect the plant.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTrichomes develop most rapidly and visibly during the blooming of the cannabis plant.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that trichomes change color as they develop. At first, they are clear, gradually becoming a cloudy, milky white, and eventually turning amber.\u00a0\r\nWhat Do Trichomes Do?\r\nTrichomes serve as both security guard and factory on the cannabis hemp plant. They protect and serve.\r\nTrichome Protection\r\nTrichomes help ensure that cannabis plants grow to their full potential. They deter insects and grazing animals, fight fungus, absorb and filter UV light, and more. How?\r\n\r\nThere are many types of trichomes, and they serve multiple purposes. Some are curved and claw-like (cystolithic trichomes), some are hairlike and provide defense (see below), and some produce and store terpenes and cannabinoids.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTrichomes known as stinging hairs contain a cocktail of serotonin, histamine, and other compounds that cause irritation and pain in grazing animals and other critters that come into contact with them.\r\n\r\nPelate hair trichomes are tiny, shield-shaped scales that protect pores on the undersides of leaves and prevent buds from drying out.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s thought that the THC and CBG cannabinoids that trichomes produce serve as an insect deterrent. Also, the terpenes that trichomes produce create scents that deter insects.\r\n\r\nSome trichomes also serve as a herbicide, protecting the hemp plant from weeds and invasive species.\r\n\r\nTrichomes have been found to be sticky enough to trap insects, and they also protect plants from UV light and wind.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe stinging and peltate hair trichomes that protect and deter are largely non-glandular trichomes.\r\n\r\nGlandular trichomes are the ones that produce the compounds that humans seek out in cannabis, which we\u2019ll discuss in detail below.\r\nTrichome Production in Cannabis\r\nTrichomes produce the three elements we rely on cannabis for the most: cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids.\u00a0\r\nCannabinoids: CBD, THC, and More\r\nCannabinoids are the most well-known compounds we find in the cannabis plant. These include our friends CBD, CBG, CBN, CBC, and their cousin, THC.\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned before, trichomes may produce cannabinoids, in part, to use them as ammunition against parasites and predators.\r\n\r\nIn humans and all animals with an endocannabinoid system (which is pretty much all animals with a spine, including dogs and cats), cannabinoids interact with receptors throughout our central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as systems that regulate sleep, digestion, immune function, mood, and more.\r\n\r\nUnlike THC, CBD and the rest of the cannabinoids present in hemp are not psychoactive, so they won\u2019t get you high.\r\nTerpenes\r\nTerpenes are the chemical compounds that create the scents of plants. They\u2019re responsible for the distinct smell of cannabis, and are also abundant in plants like tea, citrus fruits, and herbs.\r\n\r\nThey smell good, but terpenes also interact with systems in our bodies to impart their own notable healthful effects.\r\n\r\nLike trichomes, terpenes serve an important role. They attract pollinators, warn away grazing animals, and repel insects and parasites.\r\n\r\nTerpenes are the primary ingredient in essential oils.\r\n\r\nThere are roughly 400 terpenes that we know of in the cannabis plant.\r\nFlavonoids\r\nThe name flavonoid comes from the Latin word flavus, which means yellow (so, no, flavonoids are not about flavor).\r\n\r\nFlavonoids are what make apples red, cannabis green, and flowers a whole rainbow of colors, but flavonoids serve far deeper purposes in plants. They remove toxins, protect plants from invaders like microbes, and filter ultraviolet light.\r\n\r\nAnthocyanidins, found in cannabis, grapes, and berries, show potential to prevent heart disease and certain kinds of cancer. Flavonols found in cannabis, kale, and peaches are thought to have antioxidant properties.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are 6,000 known kinds of flavonoids, and 20 of them appear in the hemp plant.\r\nThe Last Word on Cannabis, Trichomes, and Cannabinoids\r\nWhile humans and animals can benefit from cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids, studying trichomes reminds us that this plant doesn\u2019t do what it does just to serve us. The cannabis plant produces trichomes, and trichomes produce cannabinoids and the rest to protect the plant itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s notable that the cannabis plant soaks up pretty much everything in the soil where it grows, including chemicals, toxins, and heavy metals. By producing trichomes, the cannabis plant essentially creates its own natural pesticide, ensuring the plant's life and reproduction without the addition of outside chemicals. So, there really is no excuse for a CBD company using chemicals to help grow cannabis. For this reason (and many more), you should always shop for organically grown, pesticide-free CBD.\u00a0\r\n\r\nJust as the cannabis plant provides incredible benefits for us, it produces a multitude of compounds for its own benefit. It\u2019s remarkable how nature knows what to do all by itself. It really doesn\u2019t need us meddling with its innate systems, power, and wisdom.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTry CBD products, like our oil tinctures, to reap the benefits of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids that trichomes produce!"},{"@type":"Person","@id":"https://cbdfx.com/#/schema/person/21a1a067185d05848645afc4bbcbb0ea","name":"Clay Steakley","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https://cbdfx.com/#personlogo","inLanguage":"en-US","url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/228d97ad8ec7035b633a602111c963fb?s=96&d=mm&r=g","contentUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/228d97ad8ec7035b633a602111c963fb?s=96&d=mm&r=g","caption":"Clay Steakley"},"description":"Clay Steakley\u2019s career has taken a lot of twists and turns over the past 20 years.

							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more we learn about the </span><b>cannabis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, the more amazing it seems. </span><a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-021-02840-x#:~:text=Trichomes%20are%20defined%20as%20unicellular,variety%20of%20species%20%5B2%5D."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are just one of the multitude of biological superpowers that we find in cannabis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are trichomes, what do they do, and why should we care?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, among a zillion other things, </span><b>trichomes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produce the </span><a href="../what-are-cannabinoids/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like </span><b>CBD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that we benefit from when we use CBD products. But that’s just the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’ll take a deep dive into trichomes and cannabinoids, but first …</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabis, Hemp, and Marijuana</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re throwing around the term “cannabis” a great deal, so it’s worth having a quick word about the type of cannabis plants we’re discussing today. The law divides cannabis into two categories: cannabis hemp and cannabis marijuana. </span><b>Hemp</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is cannabis that contains only tiny trace amounts of the cannabinoid </span><b>THC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (less than 0.3%). This makes hemp-derived products, like our CBD products, non-intoxicating. Cannabis with more THC is called </span><b>marijuana</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When we refer to the cannabis used in our CBD products, we are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talking about marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All good? Okay, on to the trichomes!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are Trichomes?</span></h2>

These are called </span><b>trichomes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, just like practically every part of the incredible cannabis plant, they serve a wide range of valuable purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most trichomes can only be seen in detail through a microscope, but these infinitesimal wonders are responsible for not only protecting the cannabis plant, but also producing the cannabinoids and other molecular compounds that make cannabis the beneficial and versatile plant that it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes may look like crystals, but they’re actually organic growths that appear on a huge range of plants and algae, including trees, vegetables, and fruit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their name comes from the Greek word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trichoma</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means hair, and that’s just what most hemp trichomes look like from a distance. However, if we zoom in, we see that there are three distinct types of trichomes found on hemp plants, and they do different things.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulbous Trichomes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulbous trichomes are the smallest of all the cannabis trichomes. They appear on the entire plant and provide the sticky quality of the flowers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitate Sessile Trichomes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitate sessile trichomes are slightly larger trichomes, and are made up of a stalk with a head, giving it a tiny mushroom appearance. They look a little like characters from an animated </span><a href="https://youtu.be/fmvS4mzWUkQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyazaki film</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These little guys are responsible for the biosynthesis of cannabinoids and terpenes, among other things.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitate-Stalked Trichomes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest trichomes, and the only ones you can observe well with the naked eye, capitate-stalked trichomes are the most abundant of the cannabis trichomes. They appear mostly on the flowers. Capitate-stalked trichomes create resin, and have the highest concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichome Development in Cannabis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cannabis hemp plant grows and develops, so do its trichomes. Gradually, trichomes produce the precursors to cannabinoids, along with the other powerful phytochemicals they make to protect the plant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes develop most rapidly and visibly during the blooming of the cannabis plant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have noticed that trichomes change color as they develop. At first, they are clear, gradually becoming a cloudy, milky white, and eventually turning amber. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Do Trichomes Do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes serve as both security guard and factory on the cannabis hemp plant. They protect and serve.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichome Protection</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes help ensure that cannabis plants grow to their full potential. They deter insects and grazing animals, fight fungus, absorb and filter UV light, and more. How?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many types of trichomes, and they serve multiple purposes. Some are curved and claw-like (cystolithic trichomes), some are hairlike and provide defense (see below), and some produce and store terpenes and cannabinoids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes known as</span><b> stinging hairs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contain a cocktail of serotonin, histamine, and other compounds that cause irritation and pain in grazing animals and other critters that come into contact with them.</span></p>
<p><b>Pelate hair</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trichomes are tiny, shield-shaped scales that protect pores on the undersides of leaves and prevent buds from drying out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s thought that the THC and </span><a href="../what-is-cbg/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannabinoids that trichomes produce serve as an insect deterrent. Also, the terpenes that trichomes produce create scents that deter insects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some trichomes also serve as a herbicide, protecting the hemp plant from weeds and invasive species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes have been found to be </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/#%21po=2.27273"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sticky enough to trap insects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they also protect plants from UV light and wind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stinging and peltate hair trichomes that protect and deter are largely </span><b>non-glandular trichomes.</b></p>
<p><b>Glandular trichomes </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">are the ones that produce the compounds that humans seek out in cannabis, which we’ll discuss in detail below.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichome Production in Cannabis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trichomes produce the three elements we rely on cannabis for the most: cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabinoids: CBD, THC, and More</span></h3>
<p><a href="../what-are-cannabinoids/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannabinoids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the most well-known compounds we find in the cannabis plant. These include our friends CBD, </span><a href="../what-is-cbg/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="../what-is-cbn-a-guide-to-cannabinol/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="../what-is-cbc-a-guide-to-cannabichromene/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and their cousin, THC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned before, trichomes may produce cannabinoids, in part, to use them as ammunition against parasites and predators.</span></p>

They’re responsible for the distinct smell of cannabis, and are also abundant in plants like tea, citrus fruits, and herbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They smell good, but terpenes also interact with systems in our bodies to impart </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009279717310487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own notable healthful effects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like trichomes, terpenes serve an important role. They attract pollinators, warn away grazing animals, and repel insects and parasites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terpenes are the primary ingredient in essential oils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cannabis-terpenes#list-of-terpenes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">400 terpenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we know of in the cannabis plant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flavonoids are what make apples red, cannabis green, and flowers a whole rainbow of colors, but flavonoids serve far deeper purposes in plants. They remove toxins, protect plants from invaders like microbes, and filter ultraviolet light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthocyanidins, found in cannabis, grapes, and berries, show </span><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-scoop-on-anthocyanins-89522"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential to prevent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heart disease and certain kinds of cancer. </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15693274/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flavonols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found in cannabis, kale, and peaches are thought to have antioxidant properties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 6,000 known kinds of flavonoids, and 20 of them appear in the hemp plant.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Last Word on Cannabis, Trichomes, and Cannabinoids</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While humans and animals can benefit from cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids, studying trichomes reminds us that this plant doesn’t do what it does just to serve us. The cannabis plant produces trichomes, and trichomes produce cannabinoids and the rest to protect the plant itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s notable that the cannabis plant soaks up pretty much everything in the soil where it grows, including chemicals, toxins, and heavy metals. By producing trichomes, the cannabis plant essentially </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates its own natural pesticide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring the plant&#8217;s life and reproduction without the addition of outside chemicals. So, there really is no excuse for a CBD company using chemicals to help grow cannabis. For this reason (and many more), you should always shop for </span><a href="../what-to-look-for-in-a-cbd-brand/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically grown, pesticide-free CBD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the cannabis plant provides incredible benefits for us, it produces a multitude of compounds for its own benefit. It’s remarkable how nature knows what to do all by itself. It really doesn’t need us meddling with its innate systems, power, and wisdom. </span></p>
